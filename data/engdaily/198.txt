As they _grow_ bigger, they are called cats. They are able to catch mice and lizards. But not all cats like eating mice, they tend to _kill_ the mice and leave them there. Cats are really _useful_ pets. They not only provide us with _amusement_ but also keep our homes free from pests like mice and lizards.
