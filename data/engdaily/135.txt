Shaka Zulu taught his tribesmen _how_ to use a short spear during war. Holding a short spear, the Zulus had to run near their _enemies_ to attack them. They also made shields _out_ of animal hide to _protect_ themselves. All these gave them an advantage _over_ the other tribes who _used_ long spears. This is _because_ once a spear is thrown, it is very difficult to remove it from the _victim's_ body.Under _the leadership of Shaka Zulu, the Zulus conquered all the surrounding tribes and_ killed _so many people that the Orange Free State and the Transvaal nearly_ became _unpopulated. In 1879, war broke out_ between _the Zulus and the British. The Zulus were_ defeated _and the British ruled_ over _Zululand. Today, many Zulus are_ working _in the mines in South Africa. However, they still return home to the kraals,_ which
are traditional dome-shaped huts.
