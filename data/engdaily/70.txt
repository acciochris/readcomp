It is often said that _if_ you want a pet to look up to you, get a dog. If you want a pet that looks straight _at_ you, get a horse. For an animal that looks down _on_ you, the cat must surely _fit_ this description.Cats are their _own_ bosses. They have _little_ or no regard for anyone or anything. If you have _ever_ looked closely at the cat, you will observe that it looks at you _from_ the corner of its eyes, almost condescendingly. If you call to it, it appears to consider if _responding_ to your call is worth its _while_ . When it finally decides to humor you, it will swagger _towards_ you, sit itself an inch away from you and start washing _itself_ . It seems to say, "Well, _get_ on with it, I don't have all day !"Cats are creatures of _habit_ . At precisely the _same_ time every day, my cat would perform the task he had been doing the day before. _When_ to mew like a whistling kettle _gone_ berserk, for its food; when to scratch the front door to be _let_ out; when to leap _onto_ my unsuspecting head in the morning ... these are all done _with_ clockwork regularity.
