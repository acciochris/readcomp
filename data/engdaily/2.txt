It was midnight when the last guest left. I sighed heavily as I looked around. The living room was _full_ of cigarette smell and stale perfume. As I looked around, I _saw_ wet patches of spilt beer on my best Persian carpet. My antique vases were totally smashed. They had even _used_ my antique oak tables as ashtrays. These guests of _mine_ had done their best to destroy my expensively decorated living room ! What a night this had turned _out_ to be.I shook my head. The mess would _take_ hours to clear. Getting _rid_ of the smell would require days. My housekeeper would had resigned _on_ the spot if she saw the mess. i had to do _something_ fast. I could not afford to lose her _as_ she is the best cook I _have_ ever hadI had no choice. I went to the bookshelf, took _out_ the book 'The Evolution of Man' by Charles Darwin and pressed on the wall behind _it_ . A small hole in the wall appeared _on_ my right. I reached _in_ and took out a long object. Then I waved it in the _air_ . The room started to clean itself _up_ . Even the antique vases started fitting themselves _together_ so well that one could not tell they had been _broken_ . As you might have guessed by _now_ , the long object is a wand, and I am what they call a witch.
