Sandwiches make a delicious snack any time. They are a common _sight_ at picnics and teas. Interestingly enough, the sandwich is the invention of _an_ eighteen century English Earl called John Montagu. Montagu was addicted _to_ card games. he would play these games _with_ his friends for long stretches of _time_ . Often, he even found it _too_ bothersome to stop his games _for_ meals.One day, _in_ the middle of a game, Montagu was served a meal of sliced meat _with_ bread. At that time, Montagu was playing the game that _required_ its players to cover cards one on top _of_ another. As Montagu looked at _both_ the game and his food, an idea came to his _mind_ ."I can do the same with my food _as_ well," he thought.He took a slice of bread, _placed_ a piece of meat on it and covered that with _another_ slice of bread. Montagu was very pleased with his invention _because_ it allowed him to play cards with one hand and eat his meal with the _other_ .Montagu's friends quickly caught _on_ to his idea and they named the new invention _after_ him. As Montagu's full title was 'the Earl of Sandwich', the new invention became known as a 'sandwich'.
