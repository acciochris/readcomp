Charles Dickens _himself_ had to work in a factory, washing bottles and sticking labels _onto_ bottles. People _looked_ down on his family and him. Dickens was unhappy and ashamed _of_ this period of his _life_ . His loss of dignity was later reflected _in_ his book, 'David Copperfield', in which the main _character_ also worked in a factory washing bottles.The family returned to a more normal life after Dickens's father _received_ a financial aid. Dickens was _sent_ to a school. School discipline in those days _was_ very harsh. Severe punishments were meted _out_ freely for slight misdemeanours. Once _again_ , Dickens suffered.Throughout _their_ trials, Dickens and his family members remained close knit and supportive of _one_ another. Dickens knew that _without_ them he would probably have been a thief and a beggar _like_ Oliver in his book 'Oliver Twist'.Among Dickens's greatest works _were_ 'Great Expectations' , 'Oliver Twist', 'The Old Curiosity Shop' and 'David Copperfield'.
