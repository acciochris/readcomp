Ali rubbed his eyes as the clock slowly chimed the _hour_ . He groaned as he _thought_ of his mother. She would die _unless_ something was done. He wished he could meet Death _face_ to face. He would _kill_ Death so that Death could not take her.Suddenly, Death appeared. He _wore_ a big black cloak that _covered_ him totally. When Death walked nearer, the cloak fell _off_ his head and little blue lights shone from _where_ the eyes should have been A skeleton-like face grinned _at_ Ali. Horrified Ali stood staring at him."I am Death," he said. "Do you have _anything_ to say to me ?" His bony _hands_ grabbed Ali as he tried to _run_ out of the room.Ali swallowed hard. He had _changed_ his mind about killing Death. In fact, all he wanted to _do_ was to get out _before_ Death kills him !"Um ... I ... " Ali's _throat_ went dry and no sound came out. Death _laughed_ menacingly. His laughter made Ali's hair stand on _end_ . It did not sound like anything he had _heard_ before !
