Michelangelo was commissioned to paint the famous Sistine Chapel walls and frescoes. This, he performed _to_ the best of his capabilities. He created a beautiful biblical presentation _of_ the birth of humanity. This _consists_ of the six days of creation and the making of Adam and Eve.Michelangelo was _also_ a sculptor. He captured the beauty of the human form _in_ his sculptures, 'David and the Slaves', 'Moses' and 'Madonna and Child'. The splendour of his art can still be viewed in Rome _today_ .Towards the last years of his _life_ , Michelangelo worked even harder, _with_ seemingly tireless energy. He developed a distinctive style of his _own_ and devoted more effort to pictures and architecture. However, he became very depressed _as_ his last days approached and _this_ was evident in his last few pieces of _work_ , 'Judgment Day' and 'Conversion of St. Paul'. They portrayed physical aggression, implying _the_ unnecessity of suffering in this world.
