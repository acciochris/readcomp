It is understandably humiliating to admit _you_ have failed. Yet, this is an essential prerequisite _to_ success. To overcome the main barrier to your _success_ , you have to admit that you are _not_ the great person you envision _yourself_ to be. Over-confidence can easily be mistaken _for_ confidence. There is but a thin boundary _between_ the two. Yet, the results can be shockingly _different_ . While one can help you _achieve_ your goal, the other can dash your dreams to _pieces_ .There is, therefore, a _need_ to be modest and unassuming. The _fruits_ of success will be sweeter. Using confidence and knowledge, strike firmly _towards_ your goal, and never be diverted _from_ it by a mild success. A premature celebration can easily obscure the task _yet_ to be performed.After you have succeeded, _use_ that confidence to improve yourself. Then personal progress can be guaranteed.
