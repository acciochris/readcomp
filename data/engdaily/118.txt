However, there are still _areas_ in our educational system which need improvement. _There_ is a need for quality education. We spend so _much_ time memorizing as many facts _as_ physically possible and then regurgitating _them_ during our examinations. There is _no_ space for experimentation nor _for_ the cultivation of genuine interest. _What_ is required is a real understanding and appreciation of a subject, _not_ merely scoring high marks.Until we learn to discard our inhibitions _about_ the freedom of creativity, we will _never_ achieve independence of thought.
