Louis Braille was born in the nineteenth century. When he was three years old, a tragic accident at his father's workshop left _him_ permanently blind. _As_ a young boy, Louis was hardworking and intelligent. His teachers suggested that he should be enrolled _in_ the National Institute for Blind Youths. At that time, this was the only school _for_ the blind in France.At the institute, Louis was eager to _learn_ to read and write. To his great disappointment, the few _books_ he found at the institute used raised letters. This method of reading was difficult for the blind, who had to feel slowly _each_ letter. By the time they _reached_ the end of a sentence, they had forgotten what the _beginning_ was about !Louis wanted to develop an _easier_ reading system for the blind. His idea of such a system _came_ from Charles Barbier, a French army officer. Barbier had invented a system called 'Night Writing', which was _made_ up of dots and dashes. Soldiers used this system to _communicate_ with one another during the night. Louis adapted this system for his own _use_ . He got _rid_ of the dashes and produced a simpler system _based_ on dots. For example, 'A' is represented _by_ a single dot. Many blind students found this system _much_ easier to use.This _came_ to be known as the 'Braille' system. Today, millions of _blind_ people are able to read, thanks to the work of a dedicated, young blind man.
