Today, we _know_ that the earth is not a flat rectangular block; it is round. We owe _this_ knowledge to the explorers who made long voyages to find _new_ routes and discover new lands. They _kept_ accurate records of the oceans they _crossed_ and the strange lands they visited. From these records, they drew up a map _of_ the world. In this way, they ended _the_ belief of a flat world.Though we know the earth _much_ better today, the spirit of exploration has not as a result come to an end. The _desire_ for adventure, the urge to set foot _on_ a wild shore and the curiosity for far-flung _places_ are still alive. Besides, not all places on earth have been fully _explored_ . Places like deserts, mountains, oceans and polar regions _still_ have secrets and mysteries to amaze _and_ surprise us. It is fortunate for us that _there_ are still many things to be discovered which _means_ that the earth remains rich and wonderful.
