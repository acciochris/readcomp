For many years, the blue whale was hunted _by_ men called whalers. They wanted a special kind of bone _found_ in the whale's mouth that is light and bends easily _without_ breaking. This whalebone was _used_ to make hoops for circular skirts that were fashionable _for_ women then. The fat, or the blubber of the whale was used to make cosmetics for women and whale meat was _sold_ in the market for consumption.Today, the blue whale is practically extinct. Other _types_ of whales, such as the killer whale and the gray whale, are _under_ special protection. The only species of whale that seems to have survived well _is_ the dolphin.
