Dance involves our sense of rhythm. We have an innate sense of rhythm in _ourselves_ . From the time we are in our mother's womb, the rhythmic rocking we _feel_ as she walks awakens our instinct _of_ movement. As babies, we are rocked _to_ sleep. As children, we _sing_ nursery rhymes and clap or dance _along_ to them. We have already begun dancing.In many countries, dance is indulged _in_ to cultivate discipline _and_ appreciation for one's native culture. For _example_ , in Africa, many tribes initiate their children _into_ adulthood through dance. Young children imitate _their_ parents' steps. Perfection of these steps signals their transition _into_ adulthood. _From_ ungainly, unsure first steps emerge refined steps. From there, an African is _able_ to modify the steps to convey the message he wants to tell.When we have mastered walking, we _learn_ the rudimentary steps of dance, be _it_ ballet, jazz or disco-dancing. From there, we are able to choreograph other steps _suited_ to the message we wish to convey. Ironically, we are able to be spontaneous _in_ the midst of discipline.
