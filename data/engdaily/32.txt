A young soldier, _whose_ plane was shot at during the war, _landed_ his plane in a forest and escaped _with_ minor injuries. He tried to make his way out of the forest but _ended_ up walking deeper and deeper _into_ it. _As_ he wandered around, he came to an old cottage. It seemed strange _to_ him that a solitary cottage should exist _in_ the heart of the forest. All the _same_ , he thanked Fortune for _taking_ pity on him.An elderly couple _lived_ in the cottage. They took the soldier in and nursed him carefully _back_ to health. They treated him as if he _was_ their own son. When he was fully _recovered_ , they gave him precise directions to get _out_ of the forest. He was grateful to them and _promised_ to visit them again.The soldier reported _back_ to camp and told his captain of the old couple's hospitality. The soldier was shocked when the captain revealed that the forest bad been _destroyed_ by bombs much earlier in the war. The elderly couple, _who_ were officially listed as dead in their records, were the parents _of_ one of their young soldiers who had died in the war.
