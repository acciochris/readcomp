Now imagine that the ice is in the _shape_ of a pyramid, with only the triangular top peeping _out_ of the water. Dip your _finger_ perpendicularly into the glass and move it _towards_ the ice slowly. You will notice that your finger will touch the _ice_ under the water before you get near to the portion _above_ the water.In the past, many ships were _sunk_ in the sea because by the _spotted_ the ships spotted a glacier, they were already _too_ near it to steer the ship away to _safety_ . Probably, the _part_ of the ice under the water would already have _made_ a hole in the hull of the ship. Now, _with_ the help of radars during navigation, a glacier can be detected _under_ water, and as such, disasters can be _avoided_ .
