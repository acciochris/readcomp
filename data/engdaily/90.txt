Jerry is the son of a wealthy businessman. One Tuesday afternoon, his chauffeur surprisingly did not _turn_ up to fetch him home from school. Jerry paced up and _down_ impatiently for half an hour. Just when he had _decided_ to take a bus home by himself, a white Mazda drove _up_ . Two burly men wearing dark sunglasses were in it. Jerry did not like the _way_ they peered at him intently from their car. Before he could say _anything_ , one of the men got out of the car quickly."Hello, you _must_ be Jerry. Your chauffeur is sick today, so your father asked us to take you back _instead_ ," the man said as he _opened_ the car door for Jerry.Jerry, however, stood rooted _to_ the spot. He was extremely suspicious _of_ the two strangers and had _no_ intention of going with them. However, before he could decline their _offer_ , he was roughly shoved _into_ the back of the car. The next moment, he _felt_ something hit his head and he fell unconscious immediately.When he came to his _senses_ , he discovered that he was in a small dark room. His hands were tightly tied _together_ behind his back with a rope. _Although_ Jerry was tired and thirsty, he was still very alert. He could _hear_ his captors talking in loud voices in the next room. they were discussing the _amount_ of money they should be able to _collect_ from Jerry's father. Jerry felt a cold chill run _down_ his spine. He _realized_ that he had been kidnapped. His kidnappers would probably demand a huge _ransom_ from his father before they would be willing to _release_ him.
