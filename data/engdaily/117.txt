I had to study late into the _night_ to prepare for my examination. Alone _in_ the hall when everyone else was _asleep_ , a very slight noise frightened me. I imagined that there was _someone_ behind me while I was memorizing mathematical formulae. Every _time_ the curtains fluttered in the wind, my heart missed a _beat_ . When my neighbour's dog barked, I broke _out_ in goose bumps because dogs are supposed to be _able_ to see spirits that are invisible to the human _eye_ . Finally, I decided to read _aloud_ so that at least I had the company of my _voice_ . Unfortunately, I soon _felt_ thirsty from it. Still I _dared_ not go to the kitchen to get a drink in _case_ a werewolf was waiting there to pounce _on_ me.After the examination, I had plenty of time on my _hands_ . What do you _think_ I did? I read everything _from_ comics to science-fiction, but I did not read a _single_ horror story this time.
