"Whoever says doctors don't _get_ sick?" he wondered to himself. He was sure that he _had_ caught his cold from one of his patients.He wished that he could go home for a good _rest_ . However, he had promised his son, Kenneth, that he would _give_ a talk during Kenneth's school assembly in half an hour's _time_ . He glanced _at_ his prepared speech and groaned. He could now _feel_ the beginnings of a bad headache.In the end, he _decided_ that he could not possibly give a speech _in_ his condition. He drove quickly to Kenneth's school and _apologized_ profusely to the Principal. Dr Miller felt bad that he had to cancel his _talk_ as he was not feeling _well_ .During assembly that day, the Principal _made_ an announcement, "Due _to_ unforeseen circumstances, Dr Miller's talk on 'How to Keep Fit' has been cancelled."
