John Amos is a salesman. He _goes_ from door to door selling vacuum cleaners. On his first day of work, he decided to sell his goods by _knocking_ on the doors of a private housing area."My first customer," he thought as he _pressed_ the doorbell of the first house. A middle aged woman _with_ curlers in her hair opened the door.John began to _explain_ who he was and the product he was selling. The next minute, the door was slammed _shut_ ."Not interested !" John heard her shout _behind_ the closed door. She refused to open the door _despite_ John's persistent knocking.John was given a similar _kind_ of treatment from the next few houses. _Feeling_ rather discouraged, he knocked at the door of the ninth household. This _time_ , the occupants of the house _let_ him in. They also _showed_ interest in his product. Encouraged by _this_ , John began to explain the merits of his vacuum cleaner. When the family _asked_ him for a demonstration, he vacuumed the place for them. _After_ the demonstration, the family, however, did not _buy_ his product. Instead, they politely but firmly told him that they would _give_ him a call if they want to buy a vacuum cleaner later.The family never called him _up_ , John suspected that they had not been really interested in his product. _What_ they had wanted was the 'free service' given by John, who had vacuumed their entire living room.
