This unusual workshop is _the_ brainchild of manager, Mr Vincent Ong. When Vincent _first_ introduced service packages at low prices, many people laughed _at_ him. They thought that he would not be able to earn _money_ . However, these low-priced packages _proved_ to be a big success _as_ they helped draw many customers. Today, the service station serves _up_ to forty cars a day.Vincent also _has_ other unusual practices. For example, he _sends_ birthday cards to his clients. He also celebrates _all_ his staff's birthdays at the station. At the end of the year, he would _give_ his staff gifts of electrical goods.
