How does a camel survive in the desert ? Many people think that the camel _stores_ water in its hump, but the hump is really made _up_ of fats. That is why you can tell a healthy camel _from_ a sick one by its hump ! A firm and tall hump indicates good _health_ while a soft and flabby one is a _sign_ of weakness.When a camel _cannot_ find water, it passes less urine to conserve _the_ small amount of water it has _in_ its body. Furthermore, the camel has a higher body temperature than _that_ of most mammals. This means that it starts to sweat _at_ a higher temperature than that _which_ human beings, for example, _start_ to perspire. This also helps it to _keep_ water loss through sweating to a minimal. Moreover, in _man_ , the loss of water thickens the blood. This is what _makes_ man need water. In a camel, its cells can release some of _its_ water content to dilute the blood.These are the reasons why a camel can go _without_ water for up to thirty-four days at a _time_ . Because of its unique ability to adapt _to_ desert conditions, it is no _wonder_ that the camel is the chief means of travel in the desert.
