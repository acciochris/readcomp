This is a story that happened during the days of Robin Hood and his merry men. One day, the Sheriff of Nottingham decided to _hold_ an archery contest. Many archers from _far_ and near came to pit their skills _against_ one another. In this contest, each archer would aim _at_ a circular disc. _Right_ in the middle of the disc was a gold circle and nay one who shot at _this_ spot would get the most points. Every archer was to shoot twelve _times_ .In the final round, there were only two teams _left_ . One of the teams _consisted_ of Little John and his two friends. The other team went first. They did extremely well. Little John's two friends _also_ performed well.It was Little John's _turn_ to shoot. In order for him to win the contest, he would _need_ to hit the gold circle nine times out of twelve.Little John was an expert archer. He stood calmly and performed an incredible _feat_ , his first seven arrows all hit the gold circle. The crowd went wild _with_ delight. His next two arrows, however, _missed_ the mark completely. With only three arrows left, Little John had to hit the gold circle twice to _win_ . His tenth shot hit the bull's-eye !Now, Little John only needed one _more_ hit to win. His next shot, however, missed the gold circle narrowly. This meant he had only one _chance_ left. As the spectators held their _breath_ , he took careful aim and hit the gold circle. The cheer that came from the crowd _was_ deafening. Little John and his team members were rewarded generously by the Sheriff.
