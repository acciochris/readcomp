Nature provides kangaroos and other marsupials with a pouch because their _young_ are born very weak and helpless. In fact, a 'Joey' as a baby kangaroo is called, is a tiny , thin mass at birth. It is not much _longer_ than three millimeters and about as thick as a lead pencil. The joey is not likely to survive _without_ the warmth and protection of its mother's pouch.The mother places the new-born baby in her pouch and _carries_ it around for six months. In six months, the joey would be as big as a puppy. However, life in the pouch is simply too good to _give_ up. So, very often the joey rides around inside with its head sticking out, far enough for it to pull off leaves when its _mother_ stops to feed on tree branches.In fact, long after it could walk and run, the joey still lives in the pouch. In case of _danger_ , the mother hops over to it, picks it up in her mouth without stopping and calmly drops it into her pouch.
