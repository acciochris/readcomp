There are many strange partnerships in the world. Crocodiles and sharks are _known_ to be ferocious carnivores. yet, they would not _attack_ each other for anything in the world.The crocodile has a little bird as a friend too, the plover, _which_ lives on the crocodile's back. The plover is often seen _inside_ the crocodile's wide open mouth, hopping daringly near it sharp teeth. This special friend _of_ the crocodile picks out little bits of food _between_ the reptile's teeth. It _also_ pecks leeches and fleas from its gums.The shark has a penchant _for_ fresh fish, but it would _never_ eat the tiny shoal of fish which swim beneath its belly. These fish are called sucker-fish and they _perform_ a two-fold function. They lure larger fishes _toward_ the shark and they clean up the _remains_ of the shark's meal at the end of _its_ feast.The rhinocerous and the buffalo, too, _have_ their helpmates. These come in the _form_ of tick-birds and egrets. They ride on these grazing bovines' _backs_ , feeding on the fleas and ticks which _would_ otherwise harm these animals. Fleas and ticks suck the blood _of_ these animals and transmit diseases _to_ them.Such partnerships, known as symbiosis, _are_ common in the animal kingdom.
