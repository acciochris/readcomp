Baboons will eat almost _anything_ . A troop of baboons on the _hunt_ for food will tear apart tree stumps for insects, rob orchards _and_ even invade farmhouses. With their long dog-like faces, sharp canine _teeth_ and restless disposition, it is _not_ surprising that they are often _thought_ of as the most dangerous and aggressive of _all_ monkeys.Today, baboons can be bred successfully in zoos. The _next_ time you go to the zoo, watch _out_ for the Arabian baboon. It is easy to recognize it because its bottom is bright red. The Egyptians used to worship the Arabian baboon and this is the _reason_ it is also called the sacred baboon.
