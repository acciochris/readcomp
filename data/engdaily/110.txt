Yet, donkeys that live _in_ the wild are fine-looking and well-built creatures. They are sociable and _have_ an average lifespan longer than _that_ of horses. Wild donkeys can _run_ even faster than horses. They are _more_ patient than horses, more evenly-tempered and more willing to _do_ tedious jobs that involve going _to_ and from the _same_ place.The donkey was the first animal domesticated by _man_ as a beast of burden. In ancient _times_ , the donkey was used frequently as a _means_ of transport in Palestine. Perhaps the best honor _given_ to this humble animal is the _fact_ that Jesus _entered_ Jerusalem riding on a donkey.
