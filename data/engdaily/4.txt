It was a Saturday afternoon. Mr. and Mrs Kerugesu were window shopping at a shopping centre. As they stood outside a boutique, Mr. Kerugesu spotted a shiny new _weighing_ machine."Look ! It's _one_ of those modern computerized machines that tells your weight and gives you your fortune at the _same_ time. I think I shall try it," he told his _wife_ .Mrs Kerugesu, however, was not too keen _about_ the idea."Let's _not_ bother. I don't _believe_ in fortune telling," she said.Mr. Kerugesu, however, insisted _on_ trying the machine. He was very curious to _find_ out his 'fortune'. He stepped on the machine and _inserted_ a fifty cent coin. There was a soft buzzing _sound_ from the machine. A few seconds _later_ , a slip of paper emerged. Mrs. Kerugesu took the slip and _read_ it out to her husband :"Your fortune : You are a clever and _talented_ person. If you are working, you will become an employee that _every_ boss would be proud of. You will become a good leader _of_ men. Everyone will listen to you _when_ you speak. _Wherever_ you lead, everyone will follow."Mrs. Kerugesu paused _for_ breath."It's got your weight _wrong_ too," she added.
