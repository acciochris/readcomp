"For a few million years, this was an island inhabited _by_ reptiles and birds. _There_ were few predators and no mammals. Until humans _arrived_ in 1535, the place _was_ a paradise. When people came in their _ships_ , rats escaped from the ships _onto_ the island. They ate a lot of bird eggs and reptilian infants. Goats and cows were reared in the _island_ to provide fresh meat for the _humans_ . These animals multiplied and grazed the whole island bare."The scientist continues, sounding fierce: "Sailors discovered tortoises could _live_ for up to a year _and_ a half without food _or_ water, and claimed that their meat _tasted_ like chicken. Tortoise populations were wiped _out_ . Hundreds of thousands of tortoises were stacked _upside_ down in ship holds. The females were especially _easily_ caught as they wandered down from the lush highlands to _lay_ their eggs in the lowlands. As people settled on the islands, their livestock and pets _ran_ wild, hunting the birds and young reptiles fearlessly. These _actions_ threatened the survival of the natural inhabitants of the Galapagos Islands."
