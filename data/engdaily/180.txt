Mr Samsudin works throughout the _night_ . His job is to make sure that the _light_ comes on at 6.30 pm and is switched off at 6.30 am _each_ day. He leads a quiet and peaceful _life_ . However, as Mr Samsudin pointed out, not all days on the island are idyllic. Just _last_ night, there was a shipwreck. Some of the _survivors_ managed to make their way to the lighthouse in _their_ lifeboats. Mr Samsudin and his crew members were _kept_ busy providing them with food and clothing and calling the coast guards to send a rescue team over to search for _missing_ victims. Shipwrecks are _common_ during this monsoon season.There are six other crew _members_ who work with Mr Samsudin on the island. Not _all_ of them live on this island throughout the year. They spend a month or so at one lighthouse and move on to the _next_ one after a break of 21 days. During the day, the crew sometimes _fish_ for their dinner and sun-dry the extra fish to bring home.Mr Samsudin is commended for being a reliable and dedicated worker.
