We were lucky today. There was going to be a hunt soon. We could faintly make _out_ the tawny body of the mighty lion stretched _on_ the grass below. He had been hiding there for at _least_ an hour now. He had been _watching_ the herd of gazelles for a long time.Presently, the lion saw a young buck stray _away_ from the herd. The lion stirred imperceptibly, almost flowing like a liquid _towards_ the unsuspecting gazelle.We _held_ our breath, anticipating the kill. Would that young animal get caught and _end_ up as a meal? The lion moved closer ...It happened _so_ quickly that we were stupefied. Out of the grass, a black-spotted gold cheetah sprang _forward_ and landed a hair's breadth _from_ the gazelle's side. In an amazing display of finesse, the gazelle veered _to_ one side, and _with_ a mighty leap, rejoined his mates in their _flight_ for freedom. At that precise _moment_ , the lion chose to leap. He landed on top of the cheetah, and what ensued was a furious _fight_ .The gazelles, in beautiful synchronized movements, escaped from their _predators_ .
