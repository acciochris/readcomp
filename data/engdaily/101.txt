Samburu National Reserve is _located_ in an entirely different terrain. Lying on the edge _of_ the great desert of northern Kenya, _it_ is a vast stretch of scrubland _inhabited_ by elephants and leopards.Mount Kenya is also a good _place_ to observe animals and plants. _If_ one drives up the flank of the mountain, _one_ would pass _through_ great bamboo jungles and mountain forests _all_ the way up to the alpine zone. With its giant plants _and_ foliage, this is a place _which_ botanists would love.
