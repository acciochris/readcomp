On the actual day, there was a huge crowd searching _for_ this gate at the Tower of London. Everyone _was_ baffled as no one knew of its existence at _all_ .

On April Fool's day, this station _showed_ a documentary on farmers in Italy harvesting spaghetti. Farmers were seen _gathering_ long strips of spaghetti from trees and shrubs. Many people were actually _taken_ in by this program. It did not _occur_ to them that spaghetti is a man-made _product_ ; it does not _grow_ on trees!
