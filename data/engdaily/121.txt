Tommy _rubbed_ his eyes sleepily and covered his face _with_ his blanket. He immediately _fell_ asleep again. When his mother came to _call_ him a second time, he said, "Mother, I don't want to go to school."He added, "I have a bad time in school _every_ day. The teachers always nag at me _because_ they don't like me. The students _are_ also very unfriendly. They avoid me _when_ they see me coming and they hardly _talk_ to me. Each day, I have this sinking feeling that everyone _makes_ fun of me behind my back. Can I _pretend_ to be sick today and not go to school just _for_ one day?"Mrs Dunn shook her head. "I'm _afraid_ not, Tommy," she said. "In fact, I can _think_ of many reasons why you should go to school. First, you are as _fit_ as a fiddle and have no reason to excuse yourself by _pretending_ to be sick. Secondly, you have a _lot_ of work to be done in school. Thirdly, you are the school Principal!"
