One of my favorite cartoons is a Walt Disney production. Donald Duck's nephews bought him a box of cigars _for_ his birthday but hid it from him as they wanted to _surprise_ him. Donald became _suspicious_ of his nephews when he saw them acting strangely. He _followed_ them secretly to their hideout and rummaged _through_ their things.When Donald Duck found the box of cigars, he _jumped_ to the conclusion that his nephews were _smoking_ in secret. He was furious and rounded _up_ his nephews. _In_ his anger, he refused to listen to his nephews' explanations. He stuffed three cigars into _each_ of their mouths and forced them to smoke _till_ they nearly went blue _in_ the face. In contrast, there was a satisfied smile on Donald's _face_ . He thought he was _punishing_ them justly for being naughty.When Donald _came_ to the last cigar, he saw a note attached to it that said: "Happy birthday, Uncle Donald!" It was _then_ that Donald remembered that his birthday was drawing _near_ . Only then did he piece things _together_ in his mind. He was so ashamed of himself that his face turned as _red_ as a tomato. He felt so small that he shrank to the _size_ of a thumb !
