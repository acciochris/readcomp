"Just _like_ the ghost stories I often hear," Lily thought, and giggled nervously. It didn't seem _as_ funny, though, as when she was _with_ her group of friends out in the warm sunshine. Here, _where_ the cold wind seemed to blow right _through_ one's bones, it was a different story.Suddenly _she froze. There was no outlet for the wind to_ enter _the house! Furthermore, there was no_ electricity _, so the fans could not have been working. Fear filled her heart. It seemed to_ beat _faster,_ sounding _just like the ticking of a clock ... a big grandfather clock. Lily_ turned _very slowly to look at the clock in the corner. It was_ ticking
very loudly!Lily screamed and ran out of the _room_ . A ghostly laugh, mixed _with_ the cry of the wind, _followed_ her hasty escape.
