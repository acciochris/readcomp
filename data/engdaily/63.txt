Albert works as a lifeguard at a beach resort. His _job_ comprises of sitting on a high chair at the beach area and _keeping_ a sharp lookout for anyone in the water who could be _in_ trouble.Albert meets _all_ kinds of people. They include families _with_ small children, elderly folk as well as young, energetic teenagers. One morning, Albert was sitting in his 'high' chair as _usual_ when he heard aÂ  voice _saying_ , "Excuse me, lifeguard." Albert looked _down_ from his chair. An anxious looking, bespectacled middle aged man stood below, _holding_ a pail."Excuse me, lifeguard," the man repeated. "Do I _have_ to pay you for getting water from the sea ?"Albert was puzzled. No one had ever asked him such a _question_ before. He decided that this man _must_ either be a country bumpkin or a lunatic."Oh, you have to pay fifty cents for _each_ pail of water you collect," said Albert jokingly. _Much_ to his surprise and amusement, the man paid him.Albert soon forget the incident _during_ the course of the day. In the late afternoon, however, he saw the man _again_ . As it was _low_ tide, the water level was much lower than _in_ the morning. When the man saw this, his eyes _grew_ wide with amazement."Why, you must have made a lot of _money_ this afternoon," he exclaimed to Albert.
