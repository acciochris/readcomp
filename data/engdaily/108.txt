During _the Chinese New Year season, stalls selling all kinds of goods, lined the street in Chinatown. Goods_ ranged _from food to clothes, flowers to household provisions. These stalls were_ opened _late into the night and hundreds of_ people _would brave the crowd to do their new year_ shopping _. It was a hot and noisy affair, but one could feel the festive_ mood _in the air amidst the crowd. The_ most _exciting day for shopping was New Year's Eve_ itself _. As midnight approached,_ prices _of goods were drastically reduced. This was because the stallholders wanted to sell_ off _their goods quickly so that they could go home to_ celebrate _the new year. It was also at_ this _time that the crowd was_ at
its thickest.In the early 1980s, the Urban Renewal Authority decided that the roadside stalls _had_ to go for hygiene _reasons_ . Thus, shopping _under_ the stars in Chinatown has become a mere memory for many people.
