When I was young, I used to enjoy watching Mother cook, especially _when_ she was preparing my favourite omelettes. When the eggs _turned_ golden and Mother flipped them _over_ , I would jump and clap my hands _with_ glee.Once, when Mother was not in, I decided to fry an egg by _myself_ . _Having_ watched Mother do it so many times before, I thought I could not go _wrong_ . First, I washed the pan. Then I _poured_ some oil into the pan. However, as the oil heated _up_ , it splattered all _over_ the stove. Some of it got on my face and arms, and I cried out _in_ pain. I was terrified and did not even try to go _near_ the pan ! After what _seemed_ like eternity, the sizzling oil _stopped_ hissing. I then turned off the stove and spent the _next_ hour cleaning up the mess.After that incident, I never wanted to _learn_ cooking. Up till now, I _still_ have not learnt the art _of_ frying anything. I would _rather_ help Mother wash the cooking utensils after she _finishes_ cooking !
