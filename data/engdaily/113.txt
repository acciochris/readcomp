Ironically, in the silk factory, it is _during_ this stage that the silk workers harvest _silk_ . The cocoon is heated to _kill_ the pupa inside it. The threads from several cocoons are then twisted _together_ to make one strong silk thread. The threads _may_ be dyed or used in its raw form to _make_ material for clothes. Perhaps now you may begin to _understand_ why articles made of silk can be _so_ expensive. Can you _imagine_ how many silkworms have to be killed in the heating process _just_ to make one silk blouse?
