We can compare the way Pavlov's dogs reacted to the bell _to_ how some of us _answer_ our examination questions. When we _study_ for our examinations, we memorize long passages from our books. We go through past years questions and familiarize _ourselves_ with how to answer them. Finally, when we actually sit for the examinations, we _have_ prepared answers in our heads. We regurgitate _these_ answers, no matter _how_ the questions are framed. _This_ can be very frustrating to the examiner _marking_ the examination papers. Such an unthinking way of answering questions can be _described_ as 'Pavlovian'.
