William Tell was a folk hero of the Swiss during the fourteenth century. At _that_ time, the governor of the country was a cruel and proud Austrian man _called_ Gessler. One day, Gessler thought of a new plan to _make_ fun of the Swiss. He _hung_ his cap on a pole at the market-place and ordered _everyone_ who passed by the pole to bow to it. The people did not want to _obey_ this ridiculous command but they _dared_ not disobey Gessler. Just then, William Tell and his son came _to_ town.When Tell and his son reached the pole, they were ordered to bow to it. Tell boldly walked _past_ without bowing. This _act_ of disobedience angered and humiliated Gessler. As Tell's punishment, the cruel governor _commanded_ that an apple should be _placed_ on the head of Tell's son. _If_ Tell could hit the apple, he would be allowed to go _free_ .The boy was led to a tree some distance _away_ . Tell took two arrows out of his quiver and _took_ careful aim. The watching crowd _held_ their breath. a second later, Tell fired. The arrow _split_ the apple into two, penetrated the tree trunk and _left_ his son unhurt. As Tell hugged his son _in_ relief, the governor said:"You really are a wonderful archer. But tell me, _why_ did you take _two_ arrows out of your quiver when you _only_ needed one just now ?"Tell looked at the governor squarely _in_ the eyes and said:"If the first arrow had _missed_ the target and I had killed my son, the second arrow was meant for you."
