As a reward, Serena's parents _gave_ their approval for her to go camping with her friends. Serena was elated. She had never _spent_ a night away from home. That would be the _first_ time. She felt grown-up and independent. "I can't _wait_ for Saturday to come!" she told her friends.Saturday _dawned bright and clear. Serena had all her things packed long before_ that _day. Her friends had_ booked _the East Coast Campsite for their stay. It was_ going _to be fun. The taxi had arrived. "Have you packed in your_ sleeping _bag?...What about your toothbrush and towels?" her mother asked as they_ walked
towards the taxi."Don't _worry_ , Mum, I have everything. I can take _care_ of myself," Serena reassured her. She placed her bags in the boot, jumped into the _taxi_ and with a final wave of her hand, was _off_ to the camp.
