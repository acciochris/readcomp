Dear Diary,I had a most unpleasant experience this morning. I was shopping _for_ a birthday present at the Tiffany Gift Shop. After deciding _on_ a beautiful musical box for Sharon, I proceeded to the cashier to pay. As I was _walking_ out of the shop, I was apprehended _by_ tow fierce looking men. They _introduced_ themselves as the security guards of the shop and _accused_ me of shoplifting. I stared at them blankly and _opened_ my mouth to protest. However, before I could _say_ a word, I was practically dragged into a nearby office.The two men insisted on _searching_ my handbag. I allowed them to do _so_ since this was the only way to prove my _innocence_ . To my horror, one of the men drew _out_ a pen from my bag. The price _tag_ on the pen carried the name of the gift shop. In a flash, I _remembered_ that I had absent-mindedly slipped this pen _into_ my bag after examining it. I explained to the two men that _it_ was an honest mistake but they would not listen. In the end, I was near tears and demanded to _see_ the manager.Unlike _the security guards, the manager was a kind and benevolent-looking man. He told me not to_ make _the mistake again and_ let
me go. What an embarrassing incident !
