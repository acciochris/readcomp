The Night Safari on Mandai Road is a quick thirty-minute _drvie_ by car from the city. Bus commuters need only to _take_ the Trans Island Bus Service 171, get off at Mandai Road and catch Service138 across the _road_ . That would take them right to this exotic paradise of wildlife in captivity.The park stretches over an _area_ of 40 hectares of secondary jungle. It is _divided_ into halves- the East Loop and the West Loop. Animals roam _freely_ through the lush grounds. Over 90% of these animals are nocturnal and are therefore most active at _night_ . The park is _home_ to more than 1200 animals. There are over 110 species. Distinguished residents include the one-horned rhinoceros, the blue sheep and the golden jackal. The Night Safari also _serves_ as a conservation centre. Rare and _endangered_ species of animals are bred here.Visitors can either _walk_ along the well-lit walking trails to see the _animals_ at close quarters or take a tram _ride_ that weaves through the East _and_ West Loop routes. That will enable them to view the animals from the comfort of the carriage.Admission to the park is by _tickets_ which are sold at $15.45 for adults and $10.30 for children _below_ the age of 13. The Night Safari is an _adventure_ not to be missed.
