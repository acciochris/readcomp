The people _who_ suffer in a war need not _only_ be the losing party. There are always two sides _to_ an argument. _Both_ warring parties will inevitably sustain casualties, and it is the people who pay _for_ all the senseless damage. _In_ a war, the soldiers _may_ be enemies to each other, but _they_ are still somebody's father, brother, son or husband. Someone will _grieve_ for them if they _die_ .Our generation in Singapore is fortunate _because_ we have not had the misfortune to go _through_ a war. Our parents and grandparents had to suffer _during_ the Japanese Occupation. Many lost their loved _ones_ then. The Second World War had been the product of a few power-crazed leaders. We should prevent _such_ tragic events _from_ recurring in the future. We should do our utmost to preserve peace, first in our _own_ lives, and then in others. Only then can we live in _harmony_ with one another.
