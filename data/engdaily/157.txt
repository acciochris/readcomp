Astronomers also think that perhaps a small _amount_ of water vapor could be found on Mars. In 1887, an Italian astronomer, Giovanni Schiaparelli, _discovered_ markings on the surface of Mars. These markings _looked_ like canals. This finding led astronomers to believe _that_ since water exists on Mars, life forms could _exist_ as well.However, there are others _who_ feel that life on Mars is not possible. This is because there is little or no _trace_ of oxygen on the planet. In 1965, the Mariner IV capsule managed to _take_ photographs of the planet. It discovered that the only forms of life found are vegetation like fungi _and_ mosses. Nevertheless, people remain fascinated _by_ the idea that one day, there could be life on Mars.
