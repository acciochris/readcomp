One night, there was a raging storm in the village. I had just finished my dinner and was settling _down_ in front of the television when I heard a loud rumble of _thunder_ . It was _followed_ by a flash of lightning. Within minutes, large _drops_ of rain were falling and a furious wind was tearing _at_ the rooftops and trees.I leapt _to_ my feet, remembering the few clothes I had left outside my window. As I _reached_ the window, I was just in time to see my entire clothes line flew _off_ into the night, my shirts and handkerchiefs flapping madly in the _wind_ . I chuckled to _myself_ , imagining a seagull meeting _them_ in mid flight.The dark night was illuminated _by_ constant flashes of lightning. Between _these_ brief flashes, I could see much of what was _happening_ in the village. Many fishermen had hurried to the edge of the sea _where_ their little fishing vessels were moored, and were pulling them further _up_ the beach. Further inland, the women were tacking storm nets to the _ground_ over their precious crops to minimize the damage _caused_ by the wind and rain. The children were rushing madly _about_ , collecting stray pets, chickens and goats into the protective _shelter_ of sheds and houses.
