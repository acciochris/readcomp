The giraffe is the tallest animal in the world. Like _other_ mammals, it has only seven bones in its neck; its height is accounted _for_ by the extraordinary _length_ of the bones.Because of its long neck, the giraffe _looks_ very clumsy when it spreads out its four _legs_ and bends down to drink. It _never_ enters deep forests where it can _easily_ be caught, or even be strangled _by_ tree branches. It _stays_ only in grassland and open country and plains. It _feeds_ on leaves and not grass; picking the leaves from trees _with_ in tongue.The soft, dark eyes of the giraffe _gives_ a giraffe its gentle look. Indeed, a giraffe in the wild _poses_ no harm to other animals. Instead, it is hunted _by_ the lion for food and by man for its _skin_ which makes good leather. The giraffe can _run_ at more than forty-five kilometers per hour, even _faster_ than a horse.The giraffe occasionally fights. It does so swinging its head and horns _into_ its opponent's neck. When two giraffes disagree _with_ each other, they will sometimes fight _until_ one of their necks is broken or dislocated.
