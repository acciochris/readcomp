At the _end_ of the song, the people in the flat above clapped and cheered loudly."That's the _last_ straw. I'm going upstairs to complain," Carol said to _herself_ . She marched to the lift and stormed upstairs. Loud strains of the _song_ 'Unchained Melody' could be _heard_ . Carol pressed the doorbell several times but there was no _reply_ . The music had _drowned_ the sound of the ringing doorbell.At the end of the song, Carol pressed the doorbell _once_ again and yelled, "Open up!" Soon, the door creaked _open_ . In the living room _was_ a group of eight tough-looking men _with_ tattoos on their arms. All of them _eyed_ her sullenly." _What_ do you want, girl?" one of them growled. "N-nothing, bye!" said Carol _in_ fright. She ran back to her flat as fast as she could.
