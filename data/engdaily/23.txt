The Israelite camp was in a state of panic. They had received a _challenge_ from their enemy, the Philistines, to fight a battle. The Philistines _sent_ their champion, Goliath, a giant over nine feet tall, as their representative _against_ the Israelites. If the Israelites _lost_ the battle, they would be _made_ the slaves of the Philistines, and vice _versa_ . For forty days, no Israelite _dared_ to volunteer to fight the gigantic Philistine.One morning, David, a young shepherd, went to the Israelite _King_ to volunteer to fight Goliath. He said that his God would help him _win_ the battle. The king was surprised _because_ David was only a young boy. However, touched _by_ the boy's faith in his God, he allowed him to _fight_ the giant.Goliath roared _with_ laughter when he saw David. He was _such_ a puny boy that even the armour was too _big_ for him ! He had no weapons _but_ a sling. David was unperturbed _by_ Goliath's ridicule. Using his sling and a stone, David _hit_ the giant right between his eyes. The stone sank _into_ Goliath's brain and _with_ a deafening roar of pain and anguish, the giant fell down and died.
