Mrs Elizabeth Sanyagi, a very wealthy lady, was worried. Recently, her favorite _pair_ of gold earrings and a silver bracelet had vanished into _thin_ air. Mrs Elizabeth Sanyagi admitted that she _had_ never been very careful about _where_ she kept her jewelry. She often left them lying _around_ the house. However, her jewelry had never disappeared _before_ . Mrs Elizabeth Sanyagi had no reason to think of _anyone_ in her household as a thief. Her three servants had been _with_ the family for more than fifteen years and had never been dishonest. They were _beyond_ suspicion. When Mrs Elizabeth Sanyagi _explain_ the situation to her son, Roger, he told her he would _help_ her catch the thief.A few days later, Roger ran _into_ her room excitedly."Mom, I've _caught_ the thief!" he said, panting. Roger went _on_ to explain."I was doing my homework _as_ usual at my desk. All of a sudden, a dark shape flew by my window. It was a magpie. The bird swooped _down_ , grabbed my silver scissors with its beak and flew off again. I trailed the bird and found it depositing my scissors into _its_ nest at the end of the garden. when I reached the nest, I discovered all the items you had _lost_ . You see, Mom, birds like the magpie are attracted _to_ shiny objects."After this speech, Roger showed his mother the objects he had retrieved _from_ the nest. In addition to Mrs Elizabeth Sanyagi's jewelry, there were three forks, two spoons, a thimble and a pair of scissors.
