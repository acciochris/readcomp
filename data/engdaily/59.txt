"Don't forget the sandwiches!" Mother reminded me. We had been _preparing_ for this family picnic for two days. Everybody, _especially_ my little brother, had been looking _forward_ to it.All of a sudden, dark clouds started to _gather_ in the sky. Soon, it began to drizzle, and _before_ long, it was pouring _cats_ and dogs. The picnic _had_ to be cancelled.I was sulking on the sofa _when_ Mother suggested, "Why _don't_ we clean up the house ?" Soon, everyone was _busy_ doing something. We dusted the furniture and _threw_ away old magazines. The store room was purged _of_ many things we had conveniently stashed _away_ inside. Father painted the cabinet, _something_ he had always said he would do but had never got round to doing. I found many old photographs and had a good laugh _over_ them. My little brother polished the glass table _so_ well that we could see our reflections _on_ it clearly.At the end of the day, we were all exhausted. _As_ the family gathered round the dining table _for_ a dinner of pizza, we were glad that the day had turned _out_ well.
