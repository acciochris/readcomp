One day, an old and fussy millionaire entered a plush restaurant to _have_ a meal. The staff of the restaurant sighed when they _saw_ him. They _knew_ he was a man who wanted the best but _was_ only willing to pay the _least_ .A menu was _placed_ in Mr. John's hands, and the waiter _waited_ patiently as the millionaire kept changing his _order_ . Finally, he _decided_ to order a bowl of oxtail soup. Relieved, the waiter _took_ the order and promptly disappeared _before_ Mr. John changed his mind again.When the dish was _served_ to the millionaire, Mr. John called _for_ the waiter again. The staff shook their _heads_ . They knew Mr. John was going to ask for proof _that_ the soup was made with real ox tail. However, the clever waiter just smiled. He was prepared for this situation. After _listening_ to the complaint, the waiter went _into_ the kitchen and dragged _out_ an ox with a bandaged tail. Speechless, the millionaire had no choice _but_ to _continue_ with his meal.
