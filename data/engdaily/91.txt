In some countries, a machine known as a lie detector is used to _help_ in criminal investigation. The lie detector is used to determine _whether_ the person involved in the crime is telling the truth or _not_ .How does such a machine work ? When a person _tells_ an untruth, certain body reactions may _occur_ . For example, his heart may _beat_ faster and his face may flush. His blood pressure may _also_ rise and his breathing may _become_ quicker. It is the _task_ of the lie detector to record these reactions. Normally, the machine _would_ record reactions which the subject has no control _over_ , such as his blood pressure, respiration or pulse.How reliable _are_ these machines ? Some countries do not use lie detectors _as_ they feel that these machines are not totally reliable. in fact, the success _rate_ of the lie detector depends greatly _on_ the sensitivity of the machine.The ability of the person _conducting_ the test is also very important. The examiner must know specifically _what_ kinds of questions to ask his subjects. The examiner would usually familiarize himself _with_ the details of the case first. He then asks his subjects _questions_ that are totally unrelated _to_ the case. The answers to these questions would _help_ the examiner gauge what _the_ 'normal' reactions of the subject _are_ . After this, the examiner would ask questions of _two_ kinds -- those that are important to the case and those which have nothing to _do_ with the case at all.
