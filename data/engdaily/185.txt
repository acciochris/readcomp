On that evening, Jonathon had _finished_ his business and Mrs Lim was walking home with the _plastic_ bag in her left hand when a mugger attacked her from _behind_ . He shoved her to the ground, grabbed her plastic bag, jumped onto his motor-cycle and _rode_ off with the spoils of his crime. Mrs Lim was too shocked to call for help. She stood rooted to the _ground_ ."Mrs Lim! Are you all right?" Mrs Lim recovered from her shock and saw her neighbor, Susan, looking _anxiously_ at her. "Somebody snatched my bag," she said. Then, she chuckled.Mrs Lim suffered a _broken_ arm but she remained good-humored about the _incident_ . "I only wish that there were a little more in the bag," she said.
