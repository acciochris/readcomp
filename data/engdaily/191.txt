Many psychologists used to believe that everyone has a fixed _amount_ of intelligence and that it could be measured in a single test. Alfred Binet designed a set of tests which was given to French children in 1905. The questions were based on what the students were taught and their _answers_ were supposed to reflect how well they could use words and numbers, follow directions and _solve_ problems in a common-sense way. Binet thought these _tests_ were useful in separating the intelligent from the dull ones. Later, he decided to do more. He wanted to find out how _smart_ a child was. "If nine-year-old Felicia was smart, was she as smart as a ten-year-old or an eleven-year-old?" The answer was given in a number now known as IQ.IQ tests were conducted to test the intelligence of children in schools. However, it was later found that some _children_ who did well in an arithmetic test did poorly on the word questions. The question of how they were to be classified arose. It became clear that intelligence is not a trait like having brown eyes and dark hair. There are _many_ ways of being smart. Many schools no longer give IQ tests. Instead, children are given many different tests to find their _strengths_ and weaknesses. They are then helped to develop their strengths and get over their weaknesses.
