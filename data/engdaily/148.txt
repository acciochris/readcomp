"I can't. I _promised_ my mother I would weed the garden today," replied Alison. She put the phone _down_ a few moments later and returned to the garden sadly. As she began weeding, _all_ she could think of was her friends having a glorious _time_ at the swimming pool."Alison," called her mother _from_ the house suddenly. "I overheard your _conversation_ with your friends. Why don't you _join_ them at the pool and do this later?""Really?" _Thanks_ , Mom!" said Alison gratefully.She was out of the house in a few minutes and headed _for_ Port Miller Swimming Pool. However, _at_ the pool, Alison could not find her friends. She searched all _over_ the place but they were nowhere in
 _sight_ . She also looked for them at their favorite places the bowling alley, the shopping centers _and_ the fast food restaurants. However, they _seemed_ to have vanished completely.When she _returned_ home a few hours later, her mother was waiting _for_ her at the front gate. To her surprise, the garden was spick and _span_ ."After you _left_ the house, your friends came here to look for you," her mother explained. "They had _come_ to help you weed the garden!"
