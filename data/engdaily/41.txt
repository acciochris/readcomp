The skunk is a creature which you probably do not want to go _near_ . What makes this animal unpopular _is_ the terrible odour it gives _off_ . The skunk has two scent glands under its tail. These glands _produce_ a smelly fluid called musk. When it meets an enemy, the skunk squirts _out_ musk in a spray. This spray is overpowering and may _cause_ sickness in the stomach. If the spray accidentally gets _into_ your eyes, you will also get temporary blindness.The skunk does not strike _before_ giving its victims plenty of warning first. the first warning the skunk _gives_ is to stamp its feet, as if it were _doing_ a little dance. _When_ this warning fails, the skunk would shake its head from side _to_ side. If the intruder _still_ does not leave, the skunk would get _ready_ to spray. Some skunks stand on their hind _legs_ to spray. Others remain _on_ all fours.Many people do not _know_ that the skunk is actually a friendly creature. In fact, it would _make_ a good pet. The skunk only sprays _in_ self-defence. It uses its spray when it feels that its _life_ is being threatened.
