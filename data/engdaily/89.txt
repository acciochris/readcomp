The whale is the largest mammal in the world. _Since_ the whale is shaped like a fish, why is it still _considered_ a mammal ? The fact is that the whale _did_ live on land a very long time ago. However, _during_ its thousands of years of living in water, the whale gradually _became_ structured like a fish. Thus, the whale has _adapted_ to marine life. Nevertheless, though the whale _resembles_ the fish externally, it still _has_ the characteristics of a mammal.One important difference _between_ a whale and a fish is that the baby whale is _born_ alive. It is not _hatched_ from an egg. Furthermore, the baby whale is fed _on_ its mother's milk just like other mammals.Unlike _other_ sea creatures, the whale is a warm blooded animal. It keeps _itself_ warm in the cold water with a layer of blubber. 'Blubber' is a layer of oily tissue _that_ protects the internal organs and retains heat.Fishes breathe _through_ their gills. Whales, however, have lungs _instead_ of gills. They breathe by using nostrils _found_ on the top of their heads. When they dive into the water, these nostrils are _closed_ so that no water can enter. Every few minutes, the whale rises _from_ the water to breathe. When it blows _out_ the used air from its lungs, water shoots out from its nostrils. _This_ creates a 'fountain' that we usually _see_ in pictures of whales.The biggest whale, the blue whale, is also the largest animal in the world. It can _grow_ to be more than one hundred feet long and is commonly found in _the_ Pacific Ocean.
