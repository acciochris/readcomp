It was past midnight. We were walking _along_ the beach enjoying the cool sea _breeze_ . Then one of us spotted _what_ we had come to look for. _Out_ of the sea came a giant leatherback turtle, crawling slowly _onto_ the beach. It had a great hard shell upon its _back_ and used its huge flippers to _move_ about effortlessly.The turtle _reached_ the middle of the beach and began digging _away_ at the sand. Large scoops of _sand_ were flung everywhere as the turtle worked _in_ deep concentration, oblivious _to_ our prying eyes. When a deep _hole_ had been dug, the turtle settled over it _for_ ten minutes. As it got up, it began _covering_ the hole with sand again.In the bright moonlight, we could see numerous round, white _eggs_ . In a month's _time_ , tiny turtles will hatch _from_ them. These baby turtles would all crawl to the _sea_ as if guided by instinct and swim away. When they reach adulthood, they _too_ would return to this spot to lay their eggs.
