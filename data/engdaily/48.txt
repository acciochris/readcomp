It was April Fool's Day. Victor, _being_ a mischievous boy, decided to play a trick _on_ his teacher, Miss Williams. He scooped his pet mouse, Snoopy _into_ his pocket and took it to school.In the middle of a science lesson, Victor _let_ Snoopy loose. The little creature at once scampered _to_ the front of the class. At _first_ , Miss Williams did not notice the mouse. She was writing on the blackboard with her _back_ facing the class. The mouse, however, decided to announce its _presence_ by giving a loud squeak. On hearing the _sound_ , Miss Williams turned around. _When_ she saw the mouse, she screamed at the _top_ of her voice and climbed on her table."Who brought this creature here ?" she demanded. However, no one heard her as the class was roaring with _laughter_ . Several students even laughed till tears rolled _down_ their cheeks. Miss Williams was _not_ amused." _If_ no one admits to playing this trick, I shall punish the whole _class_ ," she declared angrily.When the class heard this threat, they _stopped_ laughing. Everyone looked at Victor, expecting him to _own_ up. Victor, however, stared at the floor and did not say a _word_ . He was a coward _at_ heart.
