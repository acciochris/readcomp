There are many people belonging to different organizations, who try to _feed_ the hungry, heal the _sick_ and educate the ignorant. The problems of the poor are so great that it seems _only_ large organizations with huge _amount_ of money could ever hope to _solve_ them. However, one woman has _done_ a lot for the poor in Calcutta by going to the _poorest_ of the poor people alone _with_ only a few coins in her pocket. This remarkable woman is _known_ as Mother Theresa.In 1948, Mother Theresa set _out_ alone, wearing a white sari _made_ of cheap cotton cloth, with a blue border and a cross on the shoulder. She went to _stay_ with some American nursing nuns to get some medical training. She _needed_ the nursing skills so that she could be of _help_ to the poor. Then, in a little cubicle given to her _by_ a poor family, she opened a school. She _taught_ the children of the slums how to read and how to _keep_ themselves clean.Mother Theresa had no money _except_ for those few coins, no food except what she was _given_ . Soon, however, some of the girls she had taught came to her aid, and so the work of helping the slum dwellers of Calcutta _began_ to expand.
