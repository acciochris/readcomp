Today, there is a very strong emphasis _on_ the halt of CFC usage. CFCs, otherwise known as chloro-fluorocarbons, _are_ ozone-depleting chemicals. They practically burn a hole _in_ the earth's atmosphere and we, _on_ earth, suffer from the strong radiation emitted by the sun's _rays_ . Household _items_ like refrigerators, aerosol cans, air conditioners and styrofoam containers _contain_ ozone-depleting chemicals.The hole in the sky _allows_ harmful radiation to reach the earth. As a result, the temperature on earth will _rise_ . This is alarming _because_ polar ice-caps will _melt_ in the heat. Ocean levels will rise _and_ , islands will gradually be _flooded_ . More _people_ will suffer from cancer _if_ the ozone layer continues to disappear.This is _why_ governments worldwide are taking such strong measures _against_ the manufacture and continued use of CFCs. We, too, should help save the world today.
