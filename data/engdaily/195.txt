When we hook our _computer_ to another computer somewhere, we would have entered what we call cyberspace. Cyberspace is actually what happens when we hook our computer to an online service or the Internet.We need to pay a _fee_ to go online using our computer, modem and the telephone. The service _provides_ bulletin boards, chat areas, information to download and access to the Internet.The Internet is a worldwide network of computers hooked up to one another. It is _different_ from online services in that no one owns it. Anyone is free to put in information or read information from there. We can do everything on the Internet. We can _send_ and receive electronic mail. We can see pictures and download files. We can chat with other people and can even _listen_ to music and watch videos.One of the most popular things that children do online is to chat. Unlike the bulletin board, the children chat with others who are online at the same time. They read _messages_ and send their reply right then and there. It is as if one is talking to another face to _face_ . The messages are usually short but can get rather confusing as the use of certain words or acronyms may not be familiar to all.
