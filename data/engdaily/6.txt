"I will never forgive her," Anne muttered as she walked away _from_ the class. Panting and running _after_ her, Lilian came up _to_ her and apologised profusely _for_ accidentally spilling chocolate milk all _over_ Anne's new bag. Anne _refused_ to listen to Lilian. She cupped her _hands_ over her ears, glared at Lilian _and_ screamed."I'll never talk to you _again_ !" Then she ran away.Anne was _still_ angry when she reached home. She banged the door hard _behind_ her and woke Granny from her afternoon _nap_ . She was rude to Mother when Mother asked her what she _wanted_ for dinner. She _pinched_ little Tony when she found that he had messed _up_ her room again. Tony ran howling _to_ Mother. His poor arm was red _from_ Anne's pinching."What's the matter _with_ you today, Anne ?" Mother came into the room and asked. "You've made everybody upset _since_ you stepped into the house. Did something _happen_ in school ?"
