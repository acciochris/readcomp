Few other adults ever _play_ such important part in a child's life as _do_ parents. You _may_ not have liked Mrs Lim, your form teacher, but she was _not_ the ultimate authority during your childhood _years_ . Teachers may point _out_ our mistakes in class, but they do not _have_ the continuous authority _over_ us that our parents do. What is _more_ important is that the authority of the teacher _ends_ when school is over _for_ the day.
