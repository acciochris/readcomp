There are several different types of fossils. In some _cases_ , the actual remains of the organism are found to be preserved. How is _such_ a fossil formed? When an animal _dies_ , its body would naturally decompose.However, certain _parts_ of the animal's body, such as its bones or shell, take a long _time_ to decompose. _If_ this animal is quickly buried _in_ soil or rock, its bones or shell would stand a good _chance_ of being 'unspoilt' or preserved. A good _example_ of an animal that is preserved this _way_ is the mammoth, a huge furry animal _that_ resembles an elephant. Under the ice in Siberia and Alaska, whole mammoths are _found_ to be preserved.In most cases, however, we do not find the actual remains of the plant _or_ animal. This is because these remains have _already_ disintegrated. In _these_ cases, the fossils found may just _be_ the cast or mould of the bodies of animals; just like how a piece of jelly would _take_ the shape of the mould it is contained _in_ .The study of fossils is important because it is _through_ this study that we know what types of plants and animals existed on _earth_ long ago. Fossils are also able to _tell_ us about how life evolved. For example, with the study of fossils, we _know_ that the elephant is descended _from_ a creature the size of a pig!
