Not long ago, a kitten was tied in a plastic bag and then flung into a canal. It would have died _if_ it had not been rescued by a kind soul _who_ brought it to the Society for the Prevention of cruelty to Animals ( SPCA ). The throwing of this kitten into the canal is just _one_ instance of an act of cruelty towards animals.Every month, the SPCA _deals_ with animals that have been ill-treated by their owners. A common _type_ of animal abuse occurs when these pets are badly neglected by _their_ owners. Some pet owners do not _bother_ to look after their pets _when_ the poor animals are ill. By the _time_ these animals are brought to the SPCA, they are usually infected _with_ diseases. Some of _these_ diseases are so severe that it would be more humane to _put_ these animals to sleep just to _end_ their suffering. Then there are other pet owners who abandon their pets _altogether_ . These pets often suffer _from_ hunger and diseases.The SPCA _hopes_ to educate pet owners to be more responsible _towards_ their pets. Cruelty towards animals is a serious _matter_ . _Under_ the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals act, anyone found _abusing_ an animal can either be jailed up to six months, fined up to five hundred dollars, or both.
