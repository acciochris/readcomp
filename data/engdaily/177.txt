Anorexia nervosa is a disease because the person develops a distorted view of _how_ fat or thin he actually is. As a _result_ , he will continue to _deprive_ himself of food until it endangers his health.Anorexia nervosa is seen as a modern disease because today's culture equates thinness _with_ being beautiful. This _makes_ people who are fat, or even _just_ slightly overweight, to think that they are ugly. By losing some _weight_ , they hope to look better. The only legitimate _reason_ , however, for losing weight is for the _sake_ of one's health. _Apart_ from health reasons, one should learn to _accept_ one's looks as one grows older. Young girls, who are especially susceptible _to_ anorexia nervosa, should learn to _base_ their self-confidence in things _other_ than looks. For example, the personality of a person is more _important_ than his looks.
