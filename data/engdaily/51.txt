Do you know how a bee keeper gets honey from honeycombs ? First, he blows smoke _into_ the honeycomb. The bees react _by_ filling themselves with honey because their _natural_ instinct tells them that the smoke might be coming from a forest _fire._ In the event of this, the bees will move to a _new_ home. This defence mechanism has developed _over_ many years. This is _why_ bees rarely sting the person _who_ scrapes the bees away _from_ the honey comb. As a result, the bee keeper has made his job _easier_ to perform.Still, the bee keeper _takes_ precaution by wearing a long sleeved coat so that his arms will not be _exposed_ to the bees. He puts on a pair of gloves when he _handles_ the hives. He also wears a _hat_ with a veil so that the bees aren't able to _sting_ his face. He holds the hives carefully to _avoid_ knocking them and alarming the _bees_ . The bees are scraped _into_ new hives and they start _collecting_ nectar for making honey all over _again_ .
