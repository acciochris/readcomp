You are in the middle of a science test. _There_ is total silence in the class. While the others are writing _away_ furiously, you are beginning to _feel_ hungry. It is nearly recess time and you are _thinking_ of how delicious a bowl of laksa in your canteen would taste. Suddenly, _without_ any warning at all, your stomach _makes_ a loud growling sound. Your classmates _start_ to giggle and you nearly die _of_ embarrassment.Why _does your stomach behave that way ? When you are_ hungry _, your stomach begins to secrete digestive juices. The churning of these_ juices _in your stomach is what_ causes _the growling sound. When you eat something to_ satisfy _your hunger, the juices will not churn as there is now something to work_ on _. Thus, the churning of these juices_ is _the stomach's way of alerting you that it is time to_ eat
.Your brain also _plays_ an important part in informing you that you are hungry. There isÂ  part of the brain _called_ the 'appestat'. Scientists believe that it is _this_ part of the brain that tells your body _when_ you are hungry as well as when to stop eating.
