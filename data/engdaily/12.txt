"Help ! Help ! It's a gang fight !"Shoppers at Marina Centre in Singapore _heard_ cries coming from the field nearby. A girl screamed, loudly and very shrilly. The fright in her _voice_ turned Daryl's blood cold. _For_ a split second, time seemed to be frozen as the horror _of_ the situation penetrated every shopper's brain. Then, all of a sudden, everybody _started_ running towards the field. It seemed as if everyone had gone mad! Daryl ran _along_ with them, eager to see part of the action.When he _reached_ the field, the fight was over. All he could _see_ was a huge crowd huddled in the middle of the field. Daryl pushed his _way_ through the crowd and stared. _Lying_ on the ground was a teenager. His face was very pale and he was covered _with_ blood. The handle of a switch blade could be seen sticking _out_ of his stomach. Daryl began to _feel_ very sick.Suddenly, a man pushed his way _through_ the crowd and called for a little space. Obediently, the people moved _back_ . Daryl was very relieved. He _thought_ that the ambulance had arrived. However, the man whipped out a _camera_ and started taking photographs of the boy, _not_ bothered that the teenager was injured. He even tried to interview the boy. Finally, help came, but it was too _late_ . The paramedics fought to _save_ the injured teenager, but failed. Daryl looked on as the corpse was loaded into the ambulance.
