Ryan was very excited. He had been selected to _represent_ his school in the National Inter-School Decathlon Meet. A decathlon is a sport competition that _consists_ of ten individual events.On the _day_ of the competition. Ryan was at the competition grounds early. There were five other participants _besides_ himself. The first _event_ was the one hundred meters dash. When the gun _sounded_ , Ryan ran as fast as his legs could _carry_ him. To his disappointment, he only _came_ in second.As the day wore _on_ , Ryan became more and more discouraged. He had obtainedÂ  number of second and third _placings_ but he had not won a _single_ event. During the tenth event, the500 meters run, Ryan did his best, _but_ only managed to come in third. With a heavy _heart_ , he walked away, feeling that he had let his school _down_ . To his astonishment, he saw his schoolmates rushing to congratulate _him_ ."You did it, Ryan ! You won !" they shouted.Ryan _was_ dumbfounded."How _could_ I have won ? I did not _even_ win a single event !" he exclaimed.His coach _who_ was standing nearby, explained:"In a decathlon, you get a _number_ of points for each event. So what is important _is_ not just to win but to do consistently well _in_ all the events. _This_ will enable you to score many points. You won because you scored the _most_ points overall. Congratulations, Ryan. The whole school is _proud_ of you."
