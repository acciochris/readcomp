The serfs usually lived _in_ cramped and unhygienic environments in the lords' castles. _Conditions_ were so bad that diseases _spread_ very quickly. Black rats, which bred very _quickly_ in such environments, ran around, carrying diseases _on_ them. When _these_ infected rats bit other rats _or_ human beings, the diseases _were_ transmitted to their victims. This became _so_ widespread that many villages were wiped out and about one million people _died_ in just two years because of the Black Death.Because _of this, fewer and fewer people were_ willing _to work or to_ live _in the lords' manors. They demanded to be_ allowed _to rent their own land out_ of
their pay. This was the beginning of the abolition of the feudal system in Europe.
