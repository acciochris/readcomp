"Hydrogen sulphide gas, actually. Mind _your_ camera!" Alan warned, seizing her arm and drawing her _away_ as she ventured too _close_ to the hissing steam. "That vapour _contains_ hydrochloric acid, among _among_ things." Ganying clutched her camera tightly.They crouched _down_ beside one of the largest mud pools. It was two metres across, with a metre-high rim formed _by_ the splattering mud. The liquid mud slurped noisily as large bubbles of gas burst.Ganying quickly took _out_ her camera. Ganying got two marvellous shots. _One_ was of a metre-wide bubble rising into a dome. The other was _of_ a circle of droplets hanging in mid-air. She walked _on_  _towards a cream-coloured cone_ from _which steam was billowing like a mini-volcano. The smell was terrible, and the mouth of the cone was stained yellow_ by
the powdered sulphur.
