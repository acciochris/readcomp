Many years ago, there lived a couple who had a very beautiful daughter. While the husband was a man _of_ violent temper, his wife was just the _opposite_ . She was always sweet and gentle. The daughter, Alitaptap, took _after_ her mother. So it was not _surprising_ that she _had_ many admirers.Now, _among_ the men who wanted to marry her was Meopin, a rich man, _but_ a rascal. He also had a violent temper. He did not like _anyone_ to argue with him. He was picked _as_ Alitaptap's future husband _because_ of his great wealth. _On_ learning this, Alitaptap wept bitterly and _begged_ her father not to _marry_ her to Meopin. Her father refused to _listen_ .The wedding day was fixed. On the big day _itself_ , Alitaptap was _nowhere_ to be found. At first, her parents and relatives looked _for_ her in the house, but she was not there. Then they looked for her in the village. She was not there _either_ . So the villagers organized a big search party. At last they found Alitaptap, but she was _dead_ . She was _floating_ face down in a river nearby.
