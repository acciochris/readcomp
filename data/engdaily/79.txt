The story of Orpheus and Eurydice is a tragic _one_ . Orpheus is one of the most famous musicians _in_ Greek mythology. Whenever he _played_ his lyre (an instrument that _looks_ like a harp), it was said that not _only_ wild beasts _but_ even rocks and trees were moved to follow him.According to the legend, Orpheus' wife, Eurydice, died shortly _after_ their marriage from a fatal snake _bite_ . Orpheus loved Eurydice so much _that_ he went to the underworld to _ask_ the Queen of Hades, Persephone, to allow his wife to live _again_ . Charmed _by_ his music, Persephone agreed, with a _condition_ that Orpheus would not _turn_ round to look at his wife until they reached the human world.Thus, Eurydice was released. While fleeing _from_ Hades, Orpheus could not _resist_ the urge to look at his beloved wife. Moments _before_ they reached the human realm, Orpheus looked back. It was a tragic mistake.Once he _set_ his eyes on Eurydice, she disappeared, her soul _never_ to be retrieved again. Orpheus, heartbroken and guilt-ridden, was left to mourn _for_ her for the rest of his life.
