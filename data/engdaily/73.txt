One day, a boy named Narcissus went hunting in the forest. _While_ he was resting, he discovered a silvery pool of water. Looking at the water _made_ Narcissus very thirsty. He bent down for a sip to _quench_ his thirst. When he gazed at the clear surface of the pool, he saw a face looking _back_ at him. A pair of big bright eyes looked at him from a lovely face _framed_ by soft golden hair.Narcissus was fascinated _by_ this picture of beauty. He felt that it was the most beautiful face he had _ever_ seen. On an impulse, he bent forward to _kiss_ the face. However, he discovered that his lips touched _water_ instead. A sudden realization dawned _upon_ Narcissus."Why, it's _only_ my own reflection that I _see_ in the pool ! I _must_ be the most miserable of all men to _fall_ in love with my reflection !" he cried.Each day, Narcissus would stare at his reflection _in_ despair. One day, he could not stand it any longer."Goodbye, my love," he told his _reflection_ . He then _jumped_ into the pool and _drowned_ himself.Today, we call someone 'narcissistic' _if_ the person is vain and egoistic. Like Narcissus, this person is in love with _himself_ !
