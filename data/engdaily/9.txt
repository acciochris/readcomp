The sky was getting darker by the minute and strong wind was _blowing_ across the field. Soon, _drops_ of water were falling down _from_ the overcast sky.Peter did not _mind_ the rain at all. It was _better_ than playing under the hot _sun_ . He liked the _feeling_ of rain on his face and the cold sensation _when_ it soaked through his football jersey.His team had been _practising_ hard for the tournament. It had been two years _since_ they last won the Inter-Constituency Football Cup. Last year, in the game _against_ Rockingham, their team had lost _by_ just one goal. They were determined to win the Cup back this year."Goal !"His team had _scored_ again. Peter wanted to _score_ the next goal. If only he could get _past_ the two defenders, he would be able to _kick_ the ball into the goal easily.He did not _get_ to score his goal because the rain was pouring too _heavily_ and the field was getting too wet. As the boys ended their game and walked _across_ the field, Peter sneezed. he felt and unpleasant tingle of coldness running _through_ his body.
