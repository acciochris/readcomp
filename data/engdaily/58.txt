People like you and I keep pets like dogs, cats or guppies. my friend, Jennifer, however, had a most _unusual_ pet -- a snake called Cecil. Cecil was a small black snake less than one meter in _length_ . Some people were a little _afraid_ of Cecil because his fangs _looked_ threatening. However, he was a harmless creature _that_ did not bite. He was an extremely friendly creature and would even _allow_ strangers to touch and pet him. If you _put_ your hand out, Cecil would even slither _up_ your arm and coil _around_ your hand. Cecil's skin felt cool, dry and _not_ at all slimy.Cecil's home was a large green tank. To make him _feel_ more comfortable, the tank was laden _with_ his favourite branches and leaves. Surprisingly, Cecil _needed_ very little nourishment and he would eat an _average_ of only once a month. His favourite foods were lizards and live insects _like_ beetles and flies.Unfortunately _for_ Cecil, his life was cut _short_ unexpectedly. One very hot afternoon, Cecil _took_ a nap in the sun. When his owner found him later _in_ the evening, she discovered that he had _died_ from heatstroke !
