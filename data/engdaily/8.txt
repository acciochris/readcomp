Once upon a time, there was a man called Rip Van Winkle. He was a likeable _but_ lazy man who never did an ounce of _work_ in his life. His wife was always nagging _at_ him for being so lazy.One day, to _escape_ his wife's nagging, Rip Van Winkle took a stroll in the woods. In these mysterious woods, he encountered a _group_ of old men with long beards. _When_ they saw Rip Van Winkle, they offered him a drink from a flask. Rip Van Winkle took a _sip_ and found the drink delicious. As he was very thirsty, he drank to his heart's _content_ . Immediately after the drink, he felt his eyelids becoming heavy. Before he knew it, he had _fallen_ into a deep sleep.When he _woke_ up, the sun was shining brightly."I must have slept the whole night," he thought to _himself_ .As Rip Van Winkle _made_ his way home, he discovered, to his astonishment, that the landscape around him had changed. As he approached his village, he was even _more_ dumbfounded. He found that he could not recognise _anyone_ in the village ! Not only _did_ the people look different, they were also _dressed_ in a different fashion. Everyone was staring at his chin. As Rip Van Winkle looked _down_ at his own chin, he realised, to his surprise, that he had _grown_ a very long beard.After _making_ some enquiries, Rip Van Winkle realised that one hundred years had passed from the time he drank the liquid _to_ the time he woke up. This meant that he had been asleep for one hundred years !
