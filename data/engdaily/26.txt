On Sports Day, the field is _decorated_ with banners. Little coloured triangular flags are stuck in the ground _along_ the length of the track. The pavilion is the _most_ decorated area, especially _with_ its lavish display of rosettes and banners. In front of the pavilion _are_ three long wooden tables displaying the cups, trophies _and_ other medals _which_ would be given to the winners at the _end_ of the meet. A three-levelled _platform_ stand opposite the pavilion _with_ the figures 1,2 and 3 clearly marked on the _three_ different levels.All the _participants_ feel very nervous as they warm _up_ for their events. Bang ! As the gun goes _off_ for each race, the contestants would run with _all_ their strength. As the runners come near the finishing _line_ the crowd would _cheer_ the runners on. At the end of the day, the prize-winning ceremony would _take_ place. All the winners are called to step onto the platform to _receive_ their medals. Usually, a well-known person is asked to present the medals to the _winners_ .
