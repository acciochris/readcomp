Once upon a time, there lived a peasant girl named Arachne. Arachne was a very talented weaver _of_ wool. Her skilful fingers could create the _most_ intricate and beautiful tapestries in the world. _Everyone_ who knew Arachne admired and praised her _for_ her gift. They told her that Minerva, the goddess of weaving and handicraft, must have _given_ her this talent. Instead of agreeing _with_ them, Arachne was proud and scornful."Minerva indeed ! I'm quite sure I'm even _better_ than she is at weaving. In fact, I'm ready to _challenge_ her in a weaving contest," she said.When _Minerva heard about Arachne's challenge, she was very angry that a mortal had_ dared _to challenge a goddess. One day, Minerva appeared_ at _Arachne's cottage and reminded Arachne of her challenge._ In _no time, the contest began._ Both _Arachne and Minerva started to weave, their fingers moving at lightning_ speed _. When they had_ completed _their task, everyone was astounded. Arachne's tapestry was_ far _more beautiful than Minerva's ! In a fit of jealousy, Minerva_ lost
her temper."You will now do all _your_ weaving in the air !" she declared. After saying this, she _changed_ Arachne into a small black hairy creature with eight legs. As the first spider in the world, Arachne was _able_ to weave the most elaborate webs.
