Every morning, long _before_ anyone of us is awake, Grandma goes for her morning exercise in the park opposite our house. She _spends_ herself. You see, Grandma is a _retired_ nurse. She joined the service before the war and retired at the age of forty-five. She _continued_ to work as a private nurse after her retirement and only gave it up at the insistence of my father who felt that she should relax and enjoy life.Grandma also helps the maid to cook and do the marketing."Oh, Mum, _why_ must you tire yourself out? Let the maid do the work. Besides, she does not like it," Mandy used to tell her."Oh, but I do!" exclaimed Grandma, smiling broadly at her daughter-in-law.
