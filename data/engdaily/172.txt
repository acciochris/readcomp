In the early _times_ , man would domesticate animals by setting traps to _catch_ their young. A young animal is far more _easily_ domesticated than an adult one. From young, the animal _learns_ to trust and obey its owner.Many different _kinds_ of animals have been domesticated. Some common _instances_ are animals like horses, elephants, chickens and pigs. The dog, _which_ is also known as "man's best friend", is one of the first animals to have been domesticated. One of the most unusual animals to have been domesticated _is_ the pig. In England long _ago_ , the pig was a wild animal. _It_ was a ferocious and aggressive creature which was not easily captured. Yet nowadays, the domesticated pig is _no_ longer the lean and tough creature it _used_ to be!
