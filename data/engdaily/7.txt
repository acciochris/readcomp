I will always remember the trip I made to the zoo in 1988. It was then _that_ I caught measles from one of my friends, Peter, who had gone _along_ too. _Before_ he met us at the zoo, he had gone to _visit_ his cousin who was recovering _from_ measles. The next day, Peter was complaining _of_ a sore throat, a bad cold and high fever. When he was diagnosed _by_ a doctor as having measles, his parents rang _me_ up to warn me that I had been exposed _to_ measles too. By the next day,Â  I was also _showing_ the same symptoms. My doctor advised me to _stay_ at home for the next two weeks.I was quite pleased _with_ the doctor's instruction. I spent the time _reading_ storybooks, listening to music _and_ watching television. When I get _bored_ , I would call up Peter, who _also_ had to spend two weeks at home, for a chat. Unfortunately, the two weeks passed _too_ quickly. When we _returned_ to school, we had to work twice _as_ hard to catch up with our classmates. It was definitely not _worth_ the 'holiday'.
