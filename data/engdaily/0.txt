The honey bee is a very unusual kind of insect. _Unlike_ other insects which live alone, the honey bee lives as a _member_ of a community. These bees live _together_ in what is known as a bee colony.The head of the colony is called the queen bee. She is larger than the _rest_ of the bees. Her main task _in_ the colony is to lay eggs. Most of the _other_ bees are the worker bees. These bees _collect_ nectar and pollen from flowers. The nectar _that_ is carried by the worker bees is deposited on the hive and then converted _into_ honey. The worker bees also help look _after_ the young bees. as soon as the eggs are _hatched_ , the worker bees feed the young bees _with_ pollen and nectar. The third type of bee found in the colony is the drone or _male_ bee. The main task of _such_ a bee is to mate with a new queen.The queen bee has a life _span_ of about three years. _During_ this period, she would have _laid_ more than half a million eggs. _When_ the queen bee is dying, a new queen would be groomed. This new queen would eventually take _over_ the 'duties' of the old queen when the _latter_ dies.
