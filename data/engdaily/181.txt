Liu An, a sage from the Western Han Dynasty (206 BC - 25 AD) extolled the benefits of _eating_ snakes. It is believed that a bowl of snake soup keeps one warm and _improves_ one's blood circulation, thereby promoting good health.The number of snake shops in Hong Kong have _increased_ over the years. In one popular shop at the back lane of Temple Street, the shelves are lined _with_ bottles containing snakes preserved in herbs or Chinese wine. Customers _either_ buy them home or eat them prepared at the shop.At this shop, business is brisk and the proprietor is able to sell an average of a hundred snakes a day during the winter months. A bowl of ordinary snake meat _soup_ costs about S$ 3.50. However, special organs of the snake's body would cost more. These can be requested and the price may be quite exorbitant.
