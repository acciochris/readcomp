"Would you like to buy a box of matchsticks, mister ?" the little girl asked. The man _whom_ she approached did not even _stop_ to answer her. He shuffled _away_ in his great coat, eager to get home _to_ his cosy fireplace.The girl was shivering _in_ the cold. It had been _snowing_ continuously for the past two days. The girl's shoes, _which_ were already thin were thoroughly soaked. Yet, her sweet, angelic _face_ did not lose _its_ innocent smile. It only made her _look_ more pathetic when she knitted her brows sometimes. Her feet _were_ sore with painful chilblains.Someone shouted, "Watch _out_ , girl !"It was too _late_ ! The coach was going too fast and the _driver_ had not seen her earlier. There was barely enough _time_ for the little girl to take a step back. In her hurry to get to _safety_ , the basket of matchsticks fell _onto_ the snow.She _picked_ them up, wet and dirty from a puddle of melted snow. The matchstick couldn't be used now. as she began to make her way _home_ , she realised that she had lost _one_ of her shoes in the snow.
