Today, many animals are faced _with_ extinction. _The_ Californian condor, a majestic bird, and the Siberian tiger are two _such_ animals. Certain kinds of woodpeckers and alligators are also on the endangered _list_ . Some of these animals are decreasing in _number_ because people have been _hunting_ them down for their fur and skin. Others were killed _in_ large numbers in the past because they _posed_ a danger to human life.With the global trend veering _towards_ industrialization and urbanization, forests are _being_ destroyed at an alarming rate. _As_ a result, many wild animals that used to live in these forests are forced to _move_ to less fertile areas. Sometimes they simply die out in _their_ old homes when the forests gradually thin out. Hopefully, this situation can be reversed _before_ more and more animals become extinct.
