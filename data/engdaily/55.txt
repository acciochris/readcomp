Whenever you go trekking or walking _through_ a marsh, remember to watch _out_ for leeches. Leeches look _like_ earthworms but they are a nuisance. They cling _onto_ the body of a human being or an animal and _suck_ blood from it. Although it _sounds_ horrible, it does not really hurt to be _bitten_ by a leech. The leech usually drops _off_ by itself after it has had its _fill_ . In the past, leeches were _used_ as a medical tool to suck out poison _from_ the blood !You should not _try_ to pluck off the leech from your body _before_ it has finished feeding. This is _because_ the leech secretes a liquid from its mouth which _stops_ your blood from clotting while it is in the _process_ of sucking the blood. This means that _you_ will probably bleed for a while if you interrupt a leech _at_ its meal.However, if you happen to _carry_ a packet of salt with you, rub some on the leech. It will let _go_ at once at the smell of salt.
