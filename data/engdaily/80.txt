Many rivers and lakes around the world are polluted. The discharge of _waste_ materials by factories and households _causes_ pollution to rivers and lakes. The Rhine River in Europe and the Great Lakes in North America _are_ good examples of a river and lakes that are polluted. Their _water_ cannot be drunk.The _same_ thing is happening to the sea. In _one_ instance, certain factories in Japan dumped industrial waste _into_ the sea. Many people suffered _from_ lead or mercury poisoning _after_ eating fish caught in such polluted waters. Pollution in certain areas of the sea _is_ now reaching dangerous levels. Many ships discharge their waste materials _and_ unwanted engine oil into the sea. These wastes _contain_ lead and mercury which are poisonous. Sometimes, accidents _to_ oil tankers can cause oil to be discharged into the sea and _onto_ the beach.In _addition_ to discharge from factories and sewers, pollution can also come about as a _result_ of politics. Individuals _who_ want power deliberately place the living things in the sea _at_ risk. In a recent example, many barrels of oil were deliberately _poured_ into the Gulf to _prevent_ ships and soldiers from attacking the annexed shores of Kuwait.
