Many of us might not have _had_ the opportunity to _visit_ Egypt, but you _must_ have seen pictures of Egyptian mummies and the tombs _that_ they are placed in. Some of these tombs are breathtaking _in_ grandeur. The Great Pyramid at Giza, _one_ of the landmarks of Egypt today, is the _tomb_ of the Pharaoh (the Egyptian name _for_ a king) Cheops.To _the ancient Egyptians, the tomb is the real home_ of _a human being and therefore, he works hard_ during _his whole lifetime to furnish it comfortably for his_ death _. When a rich Egyptian_ dies _, his body is embalmed_ with _a huge amount of special herbs and salts to_ preserve _it. The body is then placed in a tomb to further protect it_ from _harsh weather. The dead man is_ buried _along with his material possessions, which are to_ provide _for his needs in the new world where he is supposed to_ go _. Oil, furniture, pottery and copper tools have been discovered in some tombs. In one tomb, archaeologists found a whole_ meal
comprising porridge, pigeon stew, fish and bread !
