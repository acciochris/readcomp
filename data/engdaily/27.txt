James threw his hands _up_ in frustration."Mum ! I thought I told you _before_ I didn't want anybody to touch my things. Now I can't even _find_ my socks."Mother, _who_ was hanging up the laundry in the garden, replied, "They're in the second drawer _of_ your cupboard. Your jeans are _there_ too."James was horrified. "You _washed_ my jeans ! Mum, the signatures Michael, Kelvin and Eugene _are_ on it ... do you know _if_ they are still there ?"Mother shrugged her _shoulders_ . She looked genuinely puzzle. "Why, I didn't notice. The water did look very blue ..."James went into his room, pulled _open_ the second drawer and took out a pair of jeans. They were _gone_ ! All the precious things his best friends had scribbled _on_ his jeans were _now_ just patches of colour. Oh, why didn't she just _leave_ his things alone ? She hated his Bon Jovi and Madonna posters and always told him _how_ disgusting they looked. She also always _took_ the opportunity, whenever he was _out_ , to go into his room and 'put every in _order_ ', as she puts it. To James, it was _more_ like messing it up.
