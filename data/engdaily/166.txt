The teacher's _voice_ came quietly over the intercom in her observation unit."In the First World War, many _lives_ were lost due to the way the battle was _fought_ . A deadly dance was performed daily _by_ men from both sides. They would _take_ turns to charge towards the enemy trenches, across terrain covered _with_ mines, and crawl under barbed wires. _Those_ who survived would then face heavy enemy artillery. _Under_ such circumstances, it was not _surprising_ that such charges were called 'suicide missions'.Yumei winced as rusty bayonets were _used_ to impale men who would then be _left_ to die painfully from the loss of blood, gangrene or shock. She knew that the medical facilities _were_ primitive. The surgeons did not _know_ about the need to disinfect the surgical room, nor the need to _keep_ the wound as clean as possible. Most of the young men _died_ of wounds that could easily have been healed _in_ just a few more decades.Yumei reached over and turned _off_ the observation unit. Now she understood _why_ her country censored war.
