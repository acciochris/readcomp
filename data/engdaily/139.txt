Night masked the land; relief _at_ her escape began to _give_ way to fear. The loneliness _of_ the desert night was very frightening. She shivered as a cold wind sprang up _out_ of nowhere. Danielle felt tears blur _her_ vision. She had been stupid and _because_ of that, she could die _here_ in this vast wilderness.Thoughts _of snakes and scorpions lurking unseen_ on _the ground troubled her. Above her, the moon_ shone _coldly, turning the sands_ into
an endless rippling sea.
