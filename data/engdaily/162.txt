We are reporters, sent _here_ by our editors to cover one of history's most spectacular eruptions. We come from different _parts_ of the world, and converse _in_ different languages. Yet, we are bound by the same thing - a _common_ interest in this volcano.Now and _then_ , as if to remind us of her inherent power, Etna would _give_ a mighty rumble, and quake in _an_ awesome display of strength. She has the power to send scientists from all nations scrambling _for_ the seismological machines, measuring and checking data. It has become a game for her to _keep_ everyone guessing if this last rumble could be THE rumble that would set her _off_ . The villagers have grown _tired_ of watching Etna. She has grumbled for a long time. Their lives resume, though _more_ hectic, with the influx of tourists.
