Glass makers work for years _before_ achieving the status of master craftsmen. They _join_ the glass works from a young age, working for a minimal pay _as_ apprentices. They soon _learn_ the trade and become ordinary craftsmen. _With_ the benefit of practice and experience, they will one day _become_ master craftsmen. If a particular cup or vase _requires_ a special rim or design, the master craftsman will handle it _himself_ . Otherwise, mass-produced glasses maybe moulded _in_ die casts.Great patience is needed to make a glass, for after it is shaped and _left_ aside to cool, it has to be given along interval to 'contract'. _If_ it is not 'aged' sufficiently, it will crack and disjoint.
