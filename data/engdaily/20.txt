An Indonesian folktale tells the story of a fisherman who always wanted more than what he _already_ had."If only I _were_ rich !" was the thought constantly _on_ his mind. He would never have to fish again. He would build a large house for _himself_ and have hordes of _servants_ to wait on him.One day, when the fisherman was _at_ sea, something heavy got entangled _in_ his fishing net. Cursing his bad luck, he hauled the _net_ in. Something shiny caught his _eyes_ - it was a gold chain _that_ was 'caught' in the net !"Gold ! I'll be _rich_ !" Visions of his day dreams coming _true_ raced through his _mind_ as he began to pull in the gold chain. His small _boat_ began to sink due to the _weight_ of the gold, but the man was _too_ greedy to stop. Soon, water was rushing _into_ the boat.Still, the man _continued_ pulling in the never ending gold chain. The boat eventually capsized and the gold chain _sank_ to the bottom of the sea, taking the greedy fisherman _with_ it.
