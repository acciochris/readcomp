Laura nudged me with her elbow."Look over _there_ ," she whispered. I was surprised that she was talking to me _during_ a test, but I followed the _direction_ of her eyes. Audrey was copying her _answers_ from a piece of paper she held _under_ her desk. At the other end _of_ the classroom, Miss Brown was _busy_ marking some books."Wait till Miss Brown catches Audrey _at_ it. She's bound to be _sent_ out of class," Laura whispered.Just at this moment, Miss Brown looked _up_ . Laura was bending slightly forward _to_ my side of the table."Laura Dean, _stop_ what you are doing immediately and come _here_ !" Miss Brown shouted. Laura's face _turned_ red. Desperately trying to defend _herself_ , Laura cried out :"Miss Brown, Audrey is _cheating_ !" All eyes were directed _towards_ Audrey. Suddenly, there was a rustling _sound_ of paper from her desk. Audrey had crumpled _up_ her test paper. Then she _burst_ into tears.
