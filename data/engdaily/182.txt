The shape and size of the skeleton also determine the _weight_ of a person. A person with thick bones will weigh _more_ than one with thin bones. Both may be of the _same_ height.We can test whether we have too much fat by doing the 'pinch test'. This is done by _pinching_ your side at the waistline, getting as much fat as you possibly can between your thumb and fore-finger. If there is more than 2.5 cm of it, you are probably fat.When we eat too much and do not get _enough_ exercise, the extra calories are stored as fat. Sometimes people overeat _when_ they are bored or lonely but often it is a case of not having the will power to
 _resist_ food offered to them.There are many ways to get fat _but_ only two to stay slim and healthy. One is to eat less and the _other_ is to exercise more. Exercises _like_ cycling, jogging, swimming or _playing_ games burn calories quickly and keep us fit.It is healthy to be slim. However, _being_ underweight or thin is not desirable. We _need_ to have a little fat in our body to act as a padding around the important organs and also as a _source_ of energy.People who are _thin_ usually do not like to _eat_ a lot at mealtimes. Under such circumstances, they will gain weight if they take nutritious snacks in _between_ meals.
