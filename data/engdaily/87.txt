One dark and stormy night. Peter and Tom were at a bus stop after watching a late night show. They were _waiting_ for the bus to go home. The bus that had come earlier was _so_ crowded that they could not _even_ get on it.Ten minutes later, _another_ bus arrived. This time, there were only a few _passengers_ in the bus. The two boys _stuck_ out their arms to flag it. However, the bus driver ignored them and whizzed _past_ without stopping. The boys stared after the departing bus _in_ dismay. It was past midnight already and they were still not home. Their parents _would_ probably be worried sick by now.Finally, the _third0_ bus came. Strangely enough, this bus was _moving_ very slowly. The slow _speed_ of the bus, however, did not bother the boys. They dashed _up_ the bus happily and headed _for_ the back seats.As the boys looked _around_ for the conductor, they realized to their great shock that there was no one in the bus _but6_ themselves ! Not even the driver was _there_ . As the boys sat petrified, they suddenly _heard_ two voices."I'm very hungry," said the first _voice_ ."I think there's some food left in the bus," _another_ voice replied.The boys did not wait to find out _where_ the voices came from and who they belonged to. They dashed _out_ of the bus and ran as fast as their legs could _carry_ them. If they _had_ stayed in the bus a little longer, they _would_ have heard the first voice say:"Hurry up and push harder. What a night for our bus to break down!"
