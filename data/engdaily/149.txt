Yet, ambition, _like_ money and fire, is a good servant, but a bad master. Einstein, Louis Braille and countless _other_ renowned persons succeeded because they had the ambition and determination to strive _for_ what they wanted. On _the_ other hand, there were also people like Adolf Hitler and Nero, who, _because_ of over-ambitious, failed to _become_ successful people. Instead, by _being_ slaves to their ambition, they were blinded to reality and humanity. They _lost_ the people's respect and were soon despised. Needless to _say_ , they failed in their endeavors and caused much suffering to the people they had been _put_ in charge of.Perhaps you may _think_ that people like Hitler and Einstein are far removed from _our_ ordinary lives. Nevertheless, ambition and over-ambition _are_ timeless emotions. Since the era of the cave man, ambition has led to the success and downfall _of_ many individuals. We have achieved much today, _due_ to our forefathers' ambitions and dreams. _If_ we are to progress, we will have to learn to control our ambition to help us achieve our targets.
