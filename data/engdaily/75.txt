It was a bright and sunny day. Mr. Smith lay contentedly on his picnic mat at the beach as his _children_ built sandcastles nearby. After some time, he dozed _off_ . He woke up suddenly when he _felt_ large drops of water on his forehead and nose. When he opened his eyes, he saw that it was no _longer_ sunny. The dark _clouds_ in the sky indicated that a storm was _approaching_ . He could see lightning _flashing_ in the distance. Mr. Smith ordered his children, _who_ were swimming in the sea, to come out of the water at once. Soon, his eldest son came running."Dad, I think we can seek _shelter_ under those trees," said his son pointing to a _clump_ of trees nearby."No, run to the car at once," Mr. Smith said.When they were _safe_ and sound in the car, Mr. Smith explained :"During a thunderstorm, you must be very careful _about_ safety. First of all, you must never swim _during_ a storm. Water is a good _conductor_ of electricity and you may get electrocuted if lightning should strike the _water_ . Another thing you must remember is _that_ seeking shelter under trees during storm is a foolish _thing_ to do. Lightning tends to strike at _tall_ objects and if you wait under a tree, you may be _struck_ by lightning. So the best thing to do is to _lie_ down flat in a low place."
