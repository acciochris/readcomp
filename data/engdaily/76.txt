The jigsaw puzzle was invented as an educational tool. In _the_ eighteenth century, a map maker called John Spilsbury thought of a way which makes _learning_ geography an interesting experience for children. _What_ he did was to paste maps on large blocks of wood. He then sawed the wood into _small_ pieces and put them into a box. Children had fun _putting_ the interlocking pieces together to _form_ a complete map. _While_ they did so, they also learnt more _about_ the geography of the world.Today, the jigsaw puzzle is not only _used_ for learning, it is also an entertaining way to _pass_ time. Jigsaw puzzles now come in all kinds of _shapes_ and sizes. Very young children can be _kept_ occupied with large, colorful jigsaw puzzles. For adults, _more_ complicated puzzles of at least one thousand _pieces_ could prove an interesting challenger.If you are resourceful, you may even _want_ to create your own jigsaw puzzle. All you _need_ is an interesting picture, a _piece_ of wood and a small saw. First, glue your picture firmly _onto_ the wood. Next, use a soft pencil to outline _how_ you want your jigsaw to be 'dissected'. When this is _done_ , you can then saw the wood into small pieces.
