Her first period was _with_ Secondary 1G. The class was _unusually_ quiet today. She entered the door slowly, peering cautiously at the _top_ of the door to see if there was _any_ bucket of water balanced _there_ . Much to her _relief_ , she found nothing there."Good morning, Miss Jackson," chorused the class, grinning from ear _to_ ear. Miss Jackson eyed _them_ suspiciously. _One_ popular trick her students loved to play was to switch classrooms _with_ the next class. Today, however, her students had not _changed_ classes.As the period wore _on_ , Miss Jackson grew more and more puzzled. She had expected all kinds of tricks but there were _none_ . No one took _away_ the chalk from the blackboard. Neither was there _any_ strange noise from the class. In fact, the class had never behaved so well _before_ Miss Jackson became increasingly tense. In the _end_ , she dismissed the class early and walked out _with_ a most confused look on her face.After she had _left_ , there was an uproar from the class. "Best trick we _ever_ played," said someone. "The best trick to play _on_ Miss Jackson is simply not to play any trick at all!"
