The Italians regard wine _as_ a nourishing drink, not merely a pleasure-provoking _one_ . Therefore, they _take_ pride in producing wines of quality and flavor.In the old days, wine was pressed _by_ heavy, bulky men who would run barefoot in a tank of grapes _for_ hours. Their colossal weight pressed the juice from the grapes, _which_ was then drained aside and fermented. Today, however, there are machines which perform this _job_ under more sanitized _conditions_ .Grapes are picked in the predawn hours _when_ they are freshest and juiciest. _Before_ the first rays of the sun touch them and dry them, wine pickers are already _hard_ at work. By the time day _breaks_ , the grapes are ready to be graded. White and red wine grapes are separated to be made _into_ their respective wines. Then, only the top-grade grapes make _it_ to the wine presses. These wine presses, located in modern factories, have the _capacity_ to squeeze large quantities of grapes in a short time, a far _cry_ from their inefficient ancestors.Special chemicals are _used_ to ferment the grape-juice, and they are bottled and labelled. These wines are then stored in deep, cool and dim cellars to age maturely before they are _sold_ .
