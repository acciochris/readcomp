On the coast of Brazil, the cities _are_ overcrowded. Men holding titles _to_ the jungle land are eagerly waiting to _claim_ their plot of land. Only the Indians _stand_ in their way. These title holders excuse _themselves_ by saying that to preserve a way of life _so_ unsuited to the modern world, it is _necessary_ to put the Indians in a sort of human zoo. Thus, developers have entered the jungle bringing along _with_ them diseases, drinks, money and _other_ influences that will tempt the simple jungle people _and_ destroy their way of life.
