Last evening, I decided to go for a jog. As I was _doing_ my warm-up exercises, I heard a familiar voice _calling_ my name."Hi, Mabel ! I didn't expect to see you _here_ ," the voice said. I turned around. _It_ was my classmate, Judy. When she heard I was going jogging, she asked me _whether_ she could come along. I declined at once _because_ Judy was an excellent runner and had _represented_ the school in many competitions. I told her she would probably run circles around me. However, she still insisted _on_ joining me.We started running round the track. _After_ running for about four hundred metres, I was already _out_ of breath. I had not been exercising for many weeks and my stamina was _poor_ . Judy, in contrast, ran effortlessly _by_ my side. She _cast_ a pitying glance at me and said :"We could go at a slower pace if you like.""Hah ! You think I cannot _keep_ up with you ?" I said contemptuously.I then spent the next few minutes _trying_ to prove myself right. After two laps around the track, I could not stand it any _longer_ . I came to _an_ abrupt halt. Panting heavily, I asked Judy to continue _without_ me.She ran six more laps. i was amazed by the sheer _amount_ of energy she had. Looking at her, I was _determined_ to go jogging more often to improve my stamina.
