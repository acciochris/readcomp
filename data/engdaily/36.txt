Jill was walking to her class slowly. She was worried _about_ the History test she would have to _take_ that morning. As she was reaching the classroom, a piece of paper suddenly fluttered down and _landed_ near her feet. As Jill glanced down at the paper, her heart nearly _missed_ a beat. It was the History test paper complete _with_ answers !Jill's very first thought was not to _tell_ anyone about what she had found. She would memorize _all_ the answers and do extremely _well_ in the test. After some hard thinking, however, she knew that it would be a very _dishonest_ thing to do. Besides, it would not be _fair_ to her classmates. In the _end_ , Jill returned the paper to her History teacher, Miss James."Thanks, Jill. I have been searching high and _low_ for it," said the teacher."I...I've read all the questions _already_ , Miss James," Jill confessed.Miss James _told_ her not to worry as she would think of new questions for the test. Jill's _heart_ sank. She was half hoping that the test _would_ be cancelled. Nevertheless, she did her best in the new test later that day.A few days later, the test papers were _returned_ to the class. To her pleasant surprise, Jill discovered that she had _scored_ eighty marks."You know something," she told her friends. "I could easily have scored _full_ marks if I had cheated on this test. But I wouldn't be as pleased as I am _now_ with the eighty marks I obtained."
