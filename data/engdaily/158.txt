With its razor-sharp _teeth_ and huge, tough body, the crocodile has always _instilled_ fear in man. Crocodiles can attack at any _time_ of the year. They are particularly active, however, _during_ the warmer months. Contrary to popular _belief_ , the crocodile does not _kill_ its prey by ripping _off_ its flesh. In fact, the crocodile _cannot_ chew at all. Its teeth are _designed_ only for grasping its victim firmly. The crocodile _eats_ by gulping off bits of flesh and swallowing them. It then _allows_ its powerful stomach to grind the _food_ .Since World War II, the demand for crocodile skin has increased greatly. To _meet_ these demands, crocodile farms have been formed. In these farms, crocodiles are hatched and _grown_ . They are slaughtered when they are about five or six feet _in_ length. The _skin_ of the crocodile is used to manufacture handbags, belts and shoes. In Australia, the crocodile meat is even _made_ into pies, sandwiches and sausages! An estimated 1.5 to 2 million crocodile skins are sold every year.
