Electricity-producing fishes usually have poorly developed _eyesight_ . They cannot see well and so _need_ this extraordinary ability as a _form_ of protection and as a _means_ of getting food for themselves. _Whenever_ the fish's electric field is distorted by the _presence_ of a foreign object, the fish _is_ immediately alerted. It then produces electricity _as_ a reaction. If the foreign object _happens_ to be a potential predator, it _gives_ the fish sufficient time to _make_ its escape while the enemy is temporarily immobilized _by_ the shock. If it is a smaller fish, its next _meal_ is assured.Perhaps one day, we can learn to tap the energy of such fishes and rear a tankful of them to light our homes!
