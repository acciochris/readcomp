I could not sleep at all last night. Normally, _after_ a hard day of studying, I am exhausted and would fall asleep as soon as my head touches the _pillow_ . Last night, however, I did not sleep a _wink_ . It was an especially hot and humid night. _Although_ I had the fan blowing at me, I was perspiring all _over_ . I tossed and turned in bed, _feeling_ very uncomfortable.After an hour or so, I decided to help _myself_ fall asleep by reading a book. I had heard from friends that reading a dull book can induce _sleep_ . I turned on my table lamp and began _reading_ a chapter from my chemistry text. Sure enough, I began to feel sleepy after ploughing _through_ two pages. I hurriedly tossed my book _aside_ and turned off the light. However, the minute I closed my _eyes_ , my mind was flooded _with_ the numerous chemical equations that I had read. I tried to _make_ my mind blank but could not do so. I even _resorted_ to counting sheep to make myself sleepy. _Despite_ all my efforts, sleep simply would not come.In the end, I gave up trying to sleep. I sat up in bed and gazed out of my window. _Although_ dawn was approaching, there were still a few twinkling stars in the sky. In the stillness of the night, only the crickets could be _heard_ . Lulled by the chirping of the crickets, my eyes _grew_ heavy. However, just as I was about to _doze_ off, my alarm clock rang. It was time to be up and about.
