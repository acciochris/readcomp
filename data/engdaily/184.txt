"Oh, dear! Look at the litter strewn _around_ the dustbins," Alice said in disgust. "Why can't these people _throw_ the litter into the bins instead of around them. Don't they know the objective of _having_ litter bins here in the park?""They must be real lazy bums. The environment officers _should_ come here and book them for littering the place," Belinda added.Alice and her team _picked_ up the empty packets of drinks, straws, paper and other paper products with their gloved _hands_ and put them into the litter _bags_ . They placed empty bottles and _metal_ cans in separate bags. "All these would make the recycling job _easier_ ," Miss Tan had said.The girls were busy working when suddenly they _heard_ a shout. They looked up and _saw_ an officer in uniform giving instructions to a group of people in front of him. "Good! More hands _make_ light work," Belinda exclaimed.Alice and the _other_ girls were puzzled. They wondered why the group was putting on colored jackets with the letters C.W.O. _printed_ on them. Belinda explained that the letters stand for Corrective Work Order. Those people had been _caught_ littering and cleaning up public areas like the beach was the punishment imposed on them. It is hoped that such punishment would make the offenders feel _ashamed_ of themselves for throwing litter indiscriminately.Keeping the environment clean and green is our responsibility. We need to have fresh air to live a happy and healthy life.
