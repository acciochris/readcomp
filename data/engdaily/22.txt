If you go horse-riding, you may notice that horses wear 'horseshoes' on their hooves. These U-shaped shoes, _which_ are made of hard metal, are very _important_ to the horses. If horses do not have these shoes, their hooves will _wear_ out quickly on hard _and_ brittle roads. Hence, horses _travelling_ on rough roads tend to become lame often. _Without_ shoes, horses carrying heavy loads _also_ become injured easily.In _the_ olden days, horses did not always wear shoes. Instead, horse riders would carry the horseshoes _along_ with them. These shoes would be worn _only_ if the horses were trotting on a hard or bumpy _road_ . They were usually fastened _on_ the 'horses' feet with small _pieces_ of wire. However, riders soon discovered that this _way_ of having horses 'wear shoes' was difficult and clumsy. Often, the shoes would come _off_ .In the ninth century, riders _thought_ of a way of preventing the shoes _from_ coming off. The metallic horse shoes were heated up _to_ a high temperature and then pressed _against_ the horse's hooves. By nailing the shoes _down_ , they were securely fastened onto the hooves.
