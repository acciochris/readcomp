A desert is a special region where only certain kinds of plants and animals can survive. All deserts have very _little_ water. This means that only animals and plants that can _do_ without water for long _periods_ of time can exist in the desert.Plants in the deserts are particularly adapted _to_ the dry and hot environment. _One_ well-known desert plant is the cactus. _Like_ many desert plants, this plant has very tiny leaves. As plants lose most of their water _through_ their leaves, the small leaves of the cactus help to cut _down_ water evaporation. There are _other_ desert plants that do not have leaves at all.Some desert plants survive _by_ avoiding the dry season altogether. _During_ the dry season, this plant remains as a seed and does not emerge _from_ the soil at all. When the rains come, this seed would grow very quickly _into_ a plant. It would bloom rapidly _and_ then scatter its seeds before the dry season _returns_ .Desert animals have also learnt to adapt _well_ to life in this region. The camel, for _example_ , survives well in the desert because water can be _stored_ in its body. Other desert animals _include_ rodents such as mice. These animals need very little water as they can get _all_ the water they require from their food.
