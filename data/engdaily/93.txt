When we _reached_ her house, Aunt Rebecca was on her way out."Sorry, boys," she said. "I've got to _go_ and collect my laundry. Please help _yourselves_ to your lunch in the kitchen. I'll be _back_ very soon."In
the kitchen, we found a large pizza."It smells delicious," said Douglas, sniffing the _air_ ."Don't be fooled," I warned, eyeing the pizza _with_ distaste. "The last time she baked us a pizza, I had indigestion _for_ days."We sat down for a few seconds, debating _what_ to do. We dared _not_ eat the pizza but we did not want to hurt Aunt Rebecca's feelings _either_ . She happened to _be_ our favourite relative. Just then, Aunt Rebecca's two Alsatians bounded _into_ the kitchen. Douglas and I looked at _each_ other. The _same_ idea was forming in our minds.After we had _fed_ the pizza to the dogs, we heard Aunt Rebecca opening the front door."Boys, I'm back," she called. " _Did_ you enjoy your lunch?""Oh _yes_ , it was delicious," Douglas and I chorused."Glad to _hear_ that," said Aunt Rebecca. "I had _no_ time to cook so I bought the pizza from the restaurant nearby."
