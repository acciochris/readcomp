"I understand your point, sir," said Mr Moore. "I _apologize_ for my son's behaviour. _You_ see, my family has never _been_ very good at History. I think you _can't_ really blame the boy _if_ you ask him questions about events that _happened_ long before he was born.""I see," said the Principal. "But we do _hope_ that you will be able to advise Timothy to put in a lot _more_ effort in his work. Why, he couldn't _even_ answer some of the easier history questions. For _example_ he doesn't know even the year Sir Stamford Raffles died!""I'm sorry to _hear_ that," said Mr Moore politely. "We didn't even know that Sir Stamford Raffles was sick."
