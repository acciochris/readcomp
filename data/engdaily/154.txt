Sherry nodded her _head_ expectantly and waited for the starting signal. She was in a _most_ unusual contest, the Annual Spaghetti Eating Contest. She had never _joined_ such a contest before. Together _with_ her contest partner, Peter, they would have to gobble _up_ as many plates of spaghetti as _possible_ in four minutes. There were twelve couples _participating_ in the contest.When the competition _began_ , Sherry gulped down the spaghetti as fast as she could. For the _first_ two plates, the slippery stuff slid _down_ her throat easily and she had _no_ problems eating the spaghetti. _By_ her fourth plate, however, she felt _so_ bloated that she could hardly bear to swallow the stuff. Besides, the strong _taste_ of meatballs and spaghetti sauce in her mouth was beginning to _make_ her sick. In the _middle_ of her fifth plate, she sneaked a look at Peter. He had _completed_ an admirable seven plates of spaghetti already.Much _to Sherry's relief, the contest ended. When the results were announced, Sherry and Peter discovered that they had_ emerged _third in the competition. What do you think their prize was? It was_ one
year's free supply of spaghetti at the local Spaghetti King Eating Palace!
