One morning, Dumpy was walking down the street _when_ he was spotted by a dog-catcher. The dog-catcher picked him up, _threw_ him into the back of the van, gave him a dose of gas meant to _kill_ him and drove to the nearest dumping ground.When he got there, he threw Dumpy in _front_ of a moving bulldozer. He assumed that Dumpy was dead. Dumpy suddenly _awoke_ and tried to crawl away. The dog-catcher took his rifle and shot him twice, one bullet hit his foreleg and the _other_ found its way to the chest. Dumpy kept moving forward. The driver of the bulldozer, Henry, begged the dog-catcher to put the poor dog out of his _misery_ . The dog-catcher looked at the huge pile of garbage. He did not want to _dirty_ his boots and refused to move in to kill the dog. Instead, he drove _off_ .Henry called his friends for help. They searched the dump in pouring _rain_ until they found Dumpy. He was hiding under a broken-down shack, his body _covered_ with mud and blood. They rushed the mongrel to a veterinarian and _saved_ his life.News of the incident spread. The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals protested against the _way_ the dog-catcher performed his duty. The dog-catcher received several threats from animal lovers all over town. He had to seek _police_ protection. Eventually, he emigrated.As for Dumpy, he had his name engraved on his license plate which he carried proudly round his _neck_ . One hundred families offered to adopt him but Henry had grown too attached to the stray to give him up.
