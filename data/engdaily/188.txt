The sudden awakening confused me and the dense _smoke_ in the cabin made it difficult _for_ me to find the door. I choked and gasped for breath, groping frantically for the _door_ knob. Just in time, I felt and saw a porthole. I crawled _through_ it and dropped to the deck outside.There was no apparent panic. The captain was giving out _orders_ for the safe evacuation of the _passengers_ . The crew was making frantic efforts to launch the lifeboats. All the time, the _flames_ were creeping nearer.Suddenly, someone gave me a violent _push_ . I stumbled and fell into a lifeboat. There was _difficulty_ in getting it moving. After what seemed _like_ an eternity, we were pulling away from the _ship_ . By that time, the front of the ship was a pillar of flames.Kathy had looked _forward_ to the cruise, a time to relax and recharge her store of energy. It was the first time that she was on a holiday _alone_ . Her family members and friends were unable to obtain leave from their jobs. She remembered their farewell kisses as they bid her goodbye at Collyer Quay where she had _boarded_ the passenger liner. She had been greatly impressed. The ship was a beauty to _behold_ ! There were many facilities to keep holiday-makers entertained and actively occupied. The swimming pool, the gymnasium, the billiard and _other_ games rooms as well as the theatre on board were very well managed. Activities were _drawn_ up for the next three days.It was a pity that Kathy's holiday ended that way.
