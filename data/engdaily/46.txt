Mr Jones, the manager of a large company, was worried. His money was missing. When he went _for_ a meeting this morning, he had _left_ an envelope with five hundred dollars on his table. When he returned to his office _later_ , the envelope was gone. As Mr Jones always locks his office when he leaves, no one could have _entered_ it. No one _except_ for the cleaning lady, Mary, who also had the _key_ to his office. Mary cleaned his office every morning.Mr Jones sighed. He had no choice but to _summon_ Mary to his office. Mary was soon _close_ to tears. She swore that she had not seen the envelope. Mr Jones _knew_ Mary had always been an honest and hardworking worker. However, _times_ were bad for her as her husband had been jobless for several months. As Mary was the _only_ one who could have taken the money, all suspicion _fell_ on her. Mr Jones told her firmly that if she _were_ to return the money, he would not _report_ the matter to the police.After Mary left, Mr Jones sat down to resume his work. as he opened his top drawer, he found, _to_ his horror, the missing envelope. Mr Jones suddenly _remembered_ he had put the money _there_ for safe-keeping just before going off for the meeting. He felt _ashamed_ of himself for falsely accusing Mary _of_ the theft and decided to apologise to her at _once_ .
