One cold morning in January, a businessman called Joyce C. Hall was rudely awakened by the shrill _ringing_ of the telephone. As he held the phone, the caller told him a piece of bad _news_ . Hall was informed that a fire had completely _destroyed_ his warehouse in Kansas City.Hall _was_ shattered initially. He sold cards for a _living_ and his entire stock of cards had been left in his warehouse. Among the cards lost _was_ a huge consignment of Valentine's Days cards _which_ Hall had recently ordered. These cards alone had caused him to _incur_ a debt of seventeen thousand dollars. Even the insurance money he would obtain because of the fire was far from _enough_ to allow him to pay _back_ his debt.Any _other_ person would have been completely devastated by this disaster. Hall, _however_ , was undaunted. With the help of a local banker, he managed to _get_ his company working again. By the end of that year, Hall began to print greeting cards bearing _his_ own designs.At that time, the _practice_ of sending greeting cards was seldom heard _of_ . Hall realized that he could _start_ a whole new trend. He discovered that if people came _across_ greeting cards that were beautifully drawn, they were likely to send these cards to one _another_ . Hall started to _print_ attractive, elegantly drawn Christmas cards. When these _became_ a huge success, he also printed cards for special _occasions_ like birthdays or anniversaries.Today, Hall's cards are sold in America as well as all _over_ the world. _If_ you go to a gift shop today, you are _likely_ to see the name of Hall's company -- Hallmark.
