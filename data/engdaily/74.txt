What would you do if you _won_ a million dollars in a contest ? _Would_ you spend all your money shopping for toys, clothes and books ? Would you rather take a trip _around_ the world ? Perhaps, you might _deposit_ all the money in a bank and live _on_ the interest it earns for the rest of your _life_ .Many rich people in history have _put_ their millions to worthwhile causes such as _building_ schools and hospitals. They have _donated_ their money to support orphanages and other charitable organizations. We call _these_ people philanthropists. These millions have brought _joy_ to the lives of many people. The Tan Tock Seng hospital, for _example_ , remains an important convalescent place today, _for_ people with infectious diseases. Until today, the _schools_ that Lee Kong Chian built still exist to _fulfil_ his vision of educating young people. _Though_ both these philanthropists died many years ago, _what_ they did with their money is _still_ a blessing to many Singaporeans.Would you, then, _part_ with your wealth to further the good of _other_ people ?
