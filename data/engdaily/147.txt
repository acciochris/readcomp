However, _not_ all mosquitoes bite. In fact, _only_ the female of the species sucks blood as they need the protein _for_ their eggs. Male mosquitoes live mainly _on_ plant juices or nectar from flowers.Mosquitoes detect their victims _by_ the carbon dioxide that people and animals breathe _out_ . Although holding your breath may not _prevent_ these creatures from detecting your _presence_ , you can still reduce the risk of _being_ bitten. The mosquito appears to be attracted _to_ dark-coloured clothing. Thus, by _wearing_ light coloured clothing, you would probably be bitten less. You could try wearing light coloured pants _instead_ of jeans the next time you _visit_ a mosquito-infested place. Surprisingly, the mosquito is also attracted to _scents_ like cologne or aftershave lotion. No one really knows why this is so.
