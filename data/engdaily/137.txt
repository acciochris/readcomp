In Europe, children are _taught_ to be skilful in handling food _with_ knives, forks and spoons. However, in countries _such_ as China and Korea, chopsticks are used. In _other_ countries such as India, it is _considered_ good manners to use the fingers _instead_ of cutlery.The differences _lie_ not only in the eating implements people use, _but_ also in the food itself. European children _grow_ up eating such foods as beef, potatoes and bread. In Asian _countries_ , however, people eat rice as their staple _food_ . Where most _would_ agree that duck is a tasty dish, the Japanese would recoil _in_ horror at the thought of eating ducks. _To_ them, ducks are only for ornamentation. Another _example_ of such differences would be the eating of dog meat. The Chinese _see_ dog meat as a delicacy but most Europeans would _condemn_ the practice utterly. To the Europeans, dogs are pets and _should_ not be eaten.
