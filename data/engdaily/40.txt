It was the time of the year for physical fitness tests again. The girls of Secondary 1B were lining up to _have_ their height and weight measured."Kate, it's your turn to _weigh_ yourself," Susie said."Let's _hope_ she doesn't spoil the machine !" somebody shouted. There was a roar of laughter. Kate, _feeling_ embarrassed, stepped onto the weighing machine."Sixty-two kilograms," said Miss Murphy as she _recorded_ Kate's weight onto the register. "Your _height_ is one hundred and sixty centimeters. Now, girls, go to Mr. Shane at the car park _for_ your sit-and-reach evaluation."That afternoon, Kate went home and had a good look at _herself_ in the mirror. There was no mistake _about_ it, she was really overweight for her height. However, she had been plump ever _since_ she was a baby.Kate decided to do _something_ about her weight. She started to go for regular jogs in the park near her house. She _stopped_ having snacks between meals. It was _difficult_ for her because she enjoyed eating. During the holidays, she even took _up_ swimming lessons from one of her cousins.Soon school reopened and she was getting _ready_ to go to school; she _found_ that her skirt was an inch too _loose_ . She went to her mother."Mum, can you _sew_ the buckle of my skirt further in by an inch ?" she asked. There was an unmistakable note of joy in her _voice_ . Her perseverance had paid _off_ .
