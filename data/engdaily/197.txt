Rays cannot swim _fast_ . They are slow, graceful swimmers. They are not hunters so they do not _need_ to swim at high speed to chase their prey. They feed on small _sea_ creatures which are filtered as the water containing these small creatures _enters_ the mouth and passes over _the_ gills.There are not more than 20 _species_ of rays. Most of them have taken to live permanently near the _bottom_ of the sea. There are, however, _some_ that prefer to live near the upper layers of the sea. Eagle rays and manta rays, for example, are found to swim _near_ the water surface most of the _time_ . They even leap out of the water and 'fly' for a short _distance_ before vanishing into the sea again.Some rays are very _large_ . They have a 'wing span' of about 20 meters and weigh as _heavy_ as a rhinoceros. Because of their _size_ and look, these rays are also _called_ devil fish or vampire rays. But according to skin divers, rays are mostly gentle, harmless creatures. This is shown by some divers holding on to a ray to get a free _ride_ .
