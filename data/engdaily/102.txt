Grass snakes eat insects and small animals _like_ frogs and chicks. They are good for the garden as they keep _away_ pests like rats and gophers.The more poisonous varieties _of_ snakes are the python and viper. _These_ snakes are seldom found in gardens. Instead, these snakes _live_ in forests or in dense vegetation _such_ as swampland. They do not actively seek _out_ victims, but _will_ defend themselves against potential enemies _and_ intruders. If the snake senses _someone_ coming, it would rather glide noiselessly away _than_ confront the person.Contrary to popular belief, snakes do not sting _with_ their tongue. They bite with two fangs _which_ point backwards. The snake's tongue, which continuously flicks _in_ and out, is actually its 'fingers'. Its tongue _consists_ of nerve endings which helps the snake feel the food before _eating_ it.
