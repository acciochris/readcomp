Birthdays are very special occasions. We like to _celebrate_ these occasions by having birthday cakes and presents. We also take delight _in_ throwing birthday parties and inviting our friends to _come_ over. During these parties, games like Treasure Hunt, Charades or Musical Chairs are enjoyed by _both_ the young and the young _at_ heart. In Latin America, there is a popular birthday _game_ called 'Breaking the Pinata'.A pinata is a fairly large, round object _made_ from hardened newspapers and paste. It has a hollow center which is _filled_ with sweets, chocolates and toys that children love. The outside of the pinata is lavishly decorated _with_ colorful strips of paper. Before the party _begins_ , the pinata is usually hung in a high _place_ such as the ceiling of a room.During the party, _each_ child would be blindfolded and _given_ a long stick. The children would then use the stick to poke hard at the pinata and try their _best_ to break it. Sooner or _later_ , the pinata will break. When this happens, the contents of its hollow center would spill _out_ and come tumbling _down_ . The delighted children would then scramble _about_ to collect as many presents as _possible_ . As they are still blindfolded, they will have to grope _around_ for these gifts. What an enjoyable way to celebrate a birthday !
