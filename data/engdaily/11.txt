The Red Indians were waiting for the arrival _of_ the bison. The beasts, _which_ come only once a year, are a good _source_ of meat and hide. The Red Indians needed these to _survive_ the cold, bitter winter.Tikki, the young boy, was chosen to look _out_ for the herd's arrival. Every day, he would run to the _top_ of the hill to see if he could spot them _on_ the vast horizon.One night, _while_ he was sleeping, the ground shook violently and his bag of arrows fell _off_ from its hook on the wall. Tikki rushed out of his wigwam and _felt_ a strong gust of wind and dust gush _past_ him. Shouting excitedly, he ran to the _other_ wigwams and woke everyone _up_ . A big fire was immediately _built_ and the Red Indians danced _round_ it, giving praises to their God _who_ had, at last, sent _them_ their food and clothing of animal hide. The next morning, _all_ the warrior were assigned to hunt _down_ the beasts which were grazing _near_ the river.
