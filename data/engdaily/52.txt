Someone knocked on my door one night when I was reading. I opened the door and came face to _face_ with a strange man. He was _wearing_ a pair of black spectacles and a tuxedo, _which_ was rather unusual, especially in this warm climate. In his _hand_ , he held a cane. It occurred _to_ me that I had seen this man _before_ but I could not recall when or where."Can I help you ?" I asked him.The man did not answer, but pointed his cane in the _direction_ of the backyard. When I refused to let him _enter_ , he took off his spectacles and glared at me. Held _by_ a strange force, I could not move. He wasted _no_ time in walking straight to the backyard. As he passed me, I _felt_ a cold chill envelop me. It was very strange. _Never_ before in my life had I encountered a person with _such_ power over me. A sudden impulse to scream came _over_ me, but no _sound_ came out of my mouth when I _tried_ to scream.The man suddenly reappeared, carrying a small white box. As he vanished, I realized _who_ he was. He was the previous owner of this house who had died several years _ago_ . Rumor had _it_ that he buried the ashes of his wife in a box in the backyard. I shuddered _at_ the thought. That was my only encounter with the dead !
