One of the lines from my favorite song _goes_ like this : "Love is something you do, not what you _say_ ... "Indeed, we often say that we love our families, but when was the _last_ time you took the effort to _bake_ a cake for them or sit down to _talk_ to them ? Do you _take_ time to find out what has been _happening_ in their lives ?Most of the time, we would rather _watch_ a movie or simply hang _out_ at shopping centers with our friends _than_ spend time with our family. People tend to take their families for _granted_ because they have lived with them their whole _lives_ . They do not feel the _need_ to be considerate to their families, unlike being so to their _friends_ . This is _because_ their families would always accept and love them _just_ as they are. It is usually when a person leaves his family that he _realizes_ how important his family is to him. He will then appreciate the warmth and love that a _family_ gives.Try loving your family now not with words, but by your _actions_ . Cultivate a good relationship with your family members and learn to appreciate each of them as the unique persons they _are_ .
