"I couldn't go _on_ ," Mary thought wearily. She had no idea how _far_ they had walked, or _for_ how long. It seemed like forever. She had protested once or _twice_ in the beginning that they would be wiser to _either_ remain in the jeep or return to the cool _shade_ of the trees around the oasis. Philip scolded her angrily.She stumbled and _fell_ in the sand, twisting her ankle. _Ahead_ of her was Philip. He turned and glared at her, coming back to pull her _up_ . Mary held _back_ a cry as her full weight was _put_ on her foot."Can't you try to keep _up_ with me ?" he said harshly. Mary knew better _than_ to ask him where they were going. They seemed to have been following this sandy track for a lifetime. Her face felt as _though_ it was on fire and her ankle throbbed agonizingly _with_ every step she took. Their water supply had _finished_ hours ago. She thought longingly _of_ the cool water of the oasis. Philip's outline wavered _before_ her tired eyes as she felt herself slip _into_ a world filled _with_ hallucinations and mirages.
