It was a hot afternoon. The scorching sun _shone_ mercilessly on the little village. As usual, the place was quiet. I groaned to myself as I hastily wiped _off_ the perspiration on my forehead. I would never get home _in_ this heat.As I walked along the main road, a dog _came_ rushing at me from an alley. It has foam all over _its_ mouth. _Somebody_ shouted:" _Take_ cover ! Rabies ! Mad dog !"On hearing that, I quickly glanced _around_ . All the doors to the houses were bolted. No windows were _open_ either. Nobody was _taking_ any chances. I saw a tree nearby. I ran to it and started _climbing_ , manfully ignoring the painful _bites_ of the ants in the tree."I would rather be bitten by these insects _than_ by a slavering dog," I thought at that time.Two men holding a wire noose on a long pole walked stealthily _towards_ the dog. They gauged the distance between them and the dog and neatly lassoed the animal. The dog struggled to _free_ itself _but_ the wire was thick and strong. Most importantly, the wire did not _break_ .That night, and _for_ many nights after that, my bottom was _too_ sore for me to sit down. Maybe being bitten by the dog would have hurt _less_ after all !
