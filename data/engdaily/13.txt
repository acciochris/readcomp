"You paid forty dollars for this miserable _set_ of stamps ?" Susan asked in disbelief. Michael put the stamps carefully _into_ his album. It was no _use_ telling Susan about his precious stamp collection. She, _like_ all girls, is only interested _in_ glossy fashion magazines with pouting women in designer _clothes_ and articles like 'How to lose weight _without_ eating less'.This was _no_ ordinary set of stamps. Michael had bought them _from_ Daniel as Daniel needed _money_ to buy a new walkman. Daniel said that it was a gift from his grandmother _on_ his last birthday. The stamps dated _back_ to the early part of the century. There were only a _few_ sets left in circulation today."She _said_ it's a priceless antique," Daniel had _told_ him. "My mum would be very angry with me _if_ she knew I'm selling it to you."Susan interrupted his reveries."Mother should cut _down_ on your pocket money, the way you _waste_ it on these silly stamps," she muttered.Michael felt irritated. Susan was always finding _faults_ with him about the way he _spent_ his money."What do you know ?" Michael snapped back.
