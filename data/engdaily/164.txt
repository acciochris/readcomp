Today, the initial novelty of the MRT has _worn_ off. Many people use the MRT as it is an efficient form of _transport_ , which _spares_ one from traffic jams, especially during peak _hours_ . It also _provides_ air-conditioned comfort _at_ reasonable fares. With the _introduction_ of the Transitlink system, the MRT and the Singapore Bus Service users can now _use_ one ticket for _both_ systems. This _makes_ it even more convenient to travel on the train.The Transitlink system also represents a _joint_ effort by the MRT and SBS to integrate different forms of land transport in Singapore for more efficient _travel_ . Perhaps, one day, traffic jams will become a thing of the _past_ as the traffic on the road becomes increasingly controlled.
