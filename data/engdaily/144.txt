Alexander was suffering from tuberculosis _of_ which his two brothers had died. The weather in Scotland was not _conducive_ to his health, so his father _decided_ to move to Canada in 1870.In 1873, Alexander _became_ a professor in Boston University. _Together_ with Thomas Watson, Alexander experimented _with_ electrical transmissions _of_ telegraph messages.A German, J.P. Reis, invented a telephone that _only_ transmitted music and noise, but _not_ the human voice in 1861. Alexander was convinced _that_ he could make the transmission of human voices possible. He spent many long _hours_ experimenting with the diaphragm and magnetic coil _inside_ the telephone.Finally, in 1876, he _succeeded_ , and the new telephone was born. The money he made _from_ his invention was spent _on_ the deaf. He married a deaf student, Mabel Hubbard, a year later.
