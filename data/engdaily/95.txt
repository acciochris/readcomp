One _peaceful Sunday evening, Mr Richard was washing his car at the car porch_ while _his wife was in the kitchen_ preparing _the evening meal. It was_ then _that he decided to test whether his wife was_ really
going deaf."Is dinner ready, dear?" he _called_ . His wife continued to wash the vegetables without _saying_ a word.Mr Richard was beginning to _get_ a little worried."Is dinner ready, dear?" he said in a _louder_ voice. Again, there was _no_ answer from his wife. Mr Richard's alarm _grew_ . He decided to _try_ one more time."Is dinner ready?" he shouted.Once _again, his wife ignored his_ question _and began peeling the potatoes. By now, Mr Richard was convinced_ that _his wife was indeed going deaf. He marched_ into
the kitchen and said:"Nancy, .I think there's something _wrong_ with your hearing. Why _didn't_ you answer me when I asked you _whether_ dinner is ready?"Nancy looked up _from_ her work."But I did answer you," she protested. "I said 'Not yet, dear!' loudly - three times!"
