Where _did_ this game originate from ? Some people have the _opinion_ that the game probably originated from Persia. This is because the word 'chess' is derived _from_ the Persian word `shah' which means 'king'. However, _others_ have argued that it could have been started by the Buddhists in India. According to Buddhist belief, any kind of killing is _considered_ wrong and sinful. Thus, chess was actually invented _as_ a substitute of war! No one, however, _knows_ the exact origin of the game.The individual chess pieces too have _undergone_ several changes. In ancient _times_ , the king could be captured and the game could _still_ continue. This would not be _possible_ in today's game. The piece _that_ has undergone the most changes is the queen. Today, the queen is _regarded_ as the most powerful piece in the game. In fact, when you _lose_ your queen, you feel as if you have lost the game _already_ Back in the old days, however, the queen was the weakest piece on the _board_ It could _only_ move one square at a time.Today, chess is well-known _throughout_ the world. Thousands of books have been _written_ about this game. Many people, young and _old_ , also take _part_ in chess tournaments.
