It was decided that a tractor should be _used_ . One of the men dived _in_ and reported that the taut rope disappeared _into_ a mass of weeds. It was discovered that these weeds were the main _cause_ of the difficulty. Finally, _after_ many more dives, most of the weeds were cut _away_ . A new line, this time a steel hawser, was _tied_ to the object. The tractor winch went _into_ gear, and the slow pull _began_ .Then, almost unexpectedly, a huge metal segment broke the _surface_ of the lake. _As_ it was drawn into the shallows, the object revealed _itself_ to be an enormous bronze bell, drawing _with_ it a great oozy mass from the dark depths.
