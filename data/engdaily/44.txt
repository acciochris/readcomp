( John and Mark are having lunch in the school canteen.)John : I just heard a very good riddle yesterday. Do you want to hear it ?Mark : I love riddles. Try me.John : Listen carefully. Romeo and Juliet are dead on the floor, _with_ shattered glass and spilt water all _around_ them. A man lies unconscious, _though_ not dead like Romeo and Juliet, in the _same_ room. There are no _weapons_ , such as knives _or_ guns around in the room. Now, _tell_ me who killed who and how he or she _did_ it.Mark : (thinking _so_ hard that his forehead _becomes_ furrowed) Let's see ... the man poisoned _both_ Romeo and Juliet and he _himself_ was poisoned too.John : What an imagination you _have_ ! But the answer is no.Mark : (after a long time) I give _up_ . What happened ?John : Romeo and Juliet are fishes. The man, _who_ was drunk, had walked right _into_ the fish tank, knocking it _down_ and breaking the glass _of_ the aquarium. He himself _became_ unconscious when he slipped and _fell_ , hitting his head.Mark : Fishes ! That was unfair.John : Ha ! Ha ! Ha !
