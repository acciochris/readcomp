I cleaned up the family attic last week. I had been prepared to _spend_ at least three days finishing the job. Little did I _realise_ that much more time was required.It was _not_ the accumulated junk to be tidied that _took_ up most of the time that I had bargained _for_ . What _kept_ me preoccupied was discovering the things _that_ had sentimental value, and reliving the memories that came flooding _back_ . I spent the greater part of my time running up and _down_ the stairs, yelling _to_ my wife, son or daughter, _telling_ them the history of every little item.I found my high school photographs and _remembered_ the good old days of accidentally breaking windows with baseballs. I found my son's first _pair_ of shoes. Then there was the painting of me that my daughter had _drawn_ in kindergarten. My wife's knitting, which she aborted _after_ trying to knit me a sweater, lies among the junk _too_ .So, it was this incessant reminiscing of times _gone_ by which hindered my progress. I suspect that a the end of it all, I have _just_ as much junk as before, for I could not _bear_ to throw most of the things _out_ .
