Our dreams may also have _something_ to do with our fears and longings. For example, if you long to win first prize _in_ a high-jump contest, you may dream of _yourself_ winning the competition. Finally, our 'external' environment may also _after_ our dreams. If we are hungry, cold or thirsty, our dreams may include _these_ feelings. For example, if I sleep in a very cold air-conditioned _room_ , I may dream that I am _on_ an expedition to the North Pole.People _known_ as psychoanalysts study and interpret dreams. For instance, they may say _that_ if you dream of flying in the _air_ you are a person who desires power. Of course, these interpretations may not be _accepted_ by everyone.
