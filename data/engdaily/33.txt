Getting good results in your studies comes from developing good study habits. The best _place_ to study is a comfortable room with good lighting. The best chair for studying should be _one_ which you would be comfortable _in_ , but not so comfortable that you may _fall_ asleep on it after a while ! Before you study, look for a _quiet_ environment with no distractions. If you _find_ your home too noisy for studying, try the library or community centre _instead_ .When you study, _set_ realistic targets for yourself to achieve. For example, do not _aim_ to study five chapters of Geography in one sitting _when_ you know that you take more than an hour to read one chapter. Furthermore, remember not to push yourself too _hard_ . When you have studied for a _period_ of time, reward _yourself_ by taking a short break. You could perhaps take a short walk or listen to some music for a _while_ .If you begin to _feel_ sleepy when studying, do not force yourself to go o as you may _lose_ your power of concentration. Instead, you may want to _take_ a short nap to refresh yourself. Studying may also be strenuous _on_ the eyes. When you study, it may be a good idea to _lift_ your eyes away from your books occasionally. Looking at objects at a distance or at greenery can help _soothe_ tired eyes.
