Somebody tapped me on my shoulder, I turned and saw a familiar face _before_ me. However, I could not tell _who_ she was."It's me, Maybelline. We were from the _same_ secondary school, remember ?" the girl said. I stared intently _at_ her heavily made-up face. Maybelline ? Suddenly, something clicked _in_ my brain."It's you ! I almost couldn't _recognise_ you. You look so _different_ now," I said.'Different' was _an_ understatement. She _used_ to be a plain girl in pigtails when we sat together in the same class. Now she _smelled_ of perfume and _wore_ expensive clothes. Her shoes were four inches _high_ . I had _heard_ from some of my friends that she worked _as_ a singer in a club. I could tell from her _breath_ that she smoked. I felt uncomfortable before this sophisticated person and did not _know_ how to act naturally.Fortunately for me, she was in a _hurry_ to go. Her boyfriend was _waiting_ for her, she said. As I watched her walk _away_ , I wondered what had happened to the simple, easy-going Gertrude I had once known. I _felt_ I did not know this Maybelline at all.
