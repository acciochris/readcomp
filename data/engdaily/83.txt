Mr Martin is a physical education teacher. This was his first P.E. lesson with Secondary 2F, the _most_ badly behaved class in the school. As he _walked_ to the running track, he saw forty pairs of eyes _looking_ at him suspiciously."Okay, let's begin," he said and then started to _lead_ the class in warm-up exercises."Sir," said a voice. "Can I race you _round_ the track instead ?" someone said.Mr Martin looked _at_ the direction of the voice. It was Shaun who had _spoken_ . Shaun was _the_ school's fastest runner. This was the usual challenge he _posed_ to every P.E.. teacher. Mr Martin opened his mouth to decline the challenge _but_ something about Shaun's defiant attitude made him _nod_ his head instead."Okay, _just_ once around the track," he said.The _rest_ of the class gathered around the track excitedly. It was the first _time_ any teacher had responded to the challenge. When the race began, Mr Martin ran _at_ a steady pace. Shaun, who was slightly ahead, was _indeed_ a very good runner. What Shaun _did_ not know, however, was that Mr Martin was also an excellent runner and the _holder_ of several local track records in the 1980s. _Although_ he was already thirty-five years old, Mr Martin still _showed_ the zest and energy of a much younger man. Just _before_ the finishing line, he slipped past Shaun to win the race.The class was shocked as Shaun had never been _defeated_ before. _After_ an awkward moment, Shaun held up his right hand, a _look_ of new found respect in his eyes. Mr Martin _shook_ the hand solemnly. The class clapped and cheered.From that day onwards, Mr Martin had no problems in dealing with Secondary 2F.
