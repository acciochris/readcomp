Hi! How are you? Let me _tell_ you a little of what I have been doing. Well, I'm having my long-awaited school _holidays_ right now. It's really wonderful to _have_ four whole weeks to do _what_ I like. I have been _keeping_ myself very busy. I spend my time reading and catching up with friends.Oh yes! I have also been trying to lose some _weight_ . As you know, I am a little overweight and need to _shed_ four kilogrammes to achieve my _ideal_ weight. To lose weight, I have been exercising at _least_ three times a week. I usually go swimming or cycling. Occasionally, I also invite some friends _over_ for a game of squash. I have also been _watching_ my diet very carefully. I have cut _down_ on fattening foods such as ice-cream, cakes and soft drinks. Believe me, it was a _hard_ struggle to _stop_ myself from eating these tempting and delicious foods. Finally, I have stopped my bad habit of snacking _between_ meals. _Instead_ of eating my usual packet of potato chips _when_ watching television, I would chew _on_ a carrot stick.After one and a half weeks of _following_ this routine, I discovered that I have lost one kilogramme! I am very happy with my progress and will _continue_ to do better. How are things with you? Do write to me when you are free. Bye for now!
