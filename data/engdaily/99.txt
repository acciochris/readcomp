What good luck! _Let's_ go and celebrate with this _money_ ," said Willie. "I happen to know a good restaurant _where_ we can go for a nice meal.""All you can _think_ of is food, Willie. No _wonder_ you need to go on a diet," I said. "I think we should invest the money _in_ a few good books.""You boys can _only_ think of yourselves," Laura chipped in. "I imagine that the owner of this fifty dollar note _must_ be anxiously searching for it _all_ over the place. So I suggest we look around to see _if_ we can find the owner."For the next few minutes, the three of _us_ agreed about what we _should_ do with the money."Er, there's something you guys _ought_ to know," Jim interrupted suddenly.We all turned to him. In _the_ heat of our argument, we had forgotten all _about_ him. "What is it, Jim?" Laura asked impatiently. Jim was the most quiet _member_ of our group."Well, _while_ all of you were busy arguing, a big gust of wind _blew_ the money out of my hand," Jim said.
