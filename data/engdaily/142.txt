Knowing such details about your best friend or loved one could also _tell_ you about the type of friend or partner he needs. For example, a boy with a younger sister would normally get _along_ much better with a girl _who_ has an older brother than _with_ a girl who has a younger brother. Similarly, _if_ your girlfriend is the oldest in her family, she would probably be more than a _little_ domineering.Fortunately _for_ all of us, family psychology is not totally accurate. There are always _exceptions_ to the rule. Most important of all, we should always judge _people_ according to who they are, not the relatives they have.
