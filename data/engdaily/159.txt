The Chryxus artic, another butterfly, _changes_ the darkness of its wings according to the kind of rock it rests on to _blend_ with the surroundings. Some butterflies resemble dead leaves when they lie _still_ , making it _difficult_ for birds to spot them. Some shut their wings tightly to _hide_ their colorful wings. The underside of the butterflies, which is _of_ a dull color, fades _into_ the surroundings.Perhaps, the most interesting camouflage is _that_ of the owl butterfly. It has a pattern on its wings that _resembles_ the eyes of the owl. Some birds _avoid_ it because they think it is an owl! Even the butterfly larvae have _ways_ of protecting themselves; some _have_ spikes on their bodies and others give off a bad smell _when_ they are disturbed!
