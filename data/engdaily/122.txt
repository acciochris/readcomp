Today, overweight children are becoming a common _sight_ in many countries. One possible _explanation_ for this trend is that parents nowadays tend to pamper their children a lot. They give their children plenty of money to _spend_ on chocolates, candies and fast food. _These_ foods can be very fattening. To make matters _worse_ , many children do not _like_ to exercise. They often prefer playing computer games _to_ a jog in the park.Children who are overweight can _get_ help from the Obesity Clinic. In this clinic, the overweight child learns how to _lose_ weight by eating wisely. He also learns how to eat a balanced _meal_ as well as what
 _kinds_ of food to avoid. The child is _also_ encouraged to exercise regularly.A child who is trying to lose weight _needs_ all the love and support he can get _from_ his friends and family. If you have an overweight friend, do not _make_ fun of him by calling him names. This 'harmless' teasing can be hurtful and unkind _to_ him.
