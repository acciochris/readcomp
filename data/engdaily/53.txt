Going to parties can be fun and enjoyable. If you are invited to a party, do call your host up early to _inform_ him whether you will be able to attend. If you want to _bring_ along someone who has not been invited along with you, you should ask for _permission_ first. Remember to _dress_ appropriately for the party. You will stick out like a _sore_ thumb if you are dressed formally whereas everyone _else_ is in T-shirt and jeans. If you are not sure of _what_ to wear, do ask your host.During _the party, you may perhaps like to help your host by_ offering _to serve drinks or wash the dishes. Your host_ would _certainly appreciate these efforts. If you_ happen _to be in a party where you do not know_ anyone _, do not_ try _to monopolize the host's attention. This is inconsiderate since your host has many people to attend_ to _and cannot spend all his time with you. Instead, learn to mingle_ with _the others at the party. You could try_ breaking _the ice by introducing_ yourself
to someone who is friendly looking.Before _you leave the party, remember to thank your host._ If _you have the time, you could even offer to help your host clean_ up
the place.
