About one _out_ of ten people is left-handed. As the _majority_ of the population is right-handed, the left-handed person may face problems in _performing_ his every day activities. For example, the left-handed person may have difficulties _using_ objects that are made for right-handed people. These objects _include_ can-openers, scissors and certain musical instruments.Why are some people left-handed ? One theory for _this_ is that our body is 'asymmetrical'. This _means_ that both halves of our bodies are not _exactly_ the same. For example, your right foot may be slightly larger than your left _one_ . Your right hand may be different in appearance _from_ your left. This kind of 'asymmetry' takes _place_ throughout the entire body.When we come _to_ the brain, there is a left half and a right half as _well_ . These _two_ halves have very different functions. The left half of the brain deals _with_ logical functions such as reading and writing. The right half, on the other _hand_ , helps us to think creatively. For people who are right-handed, it is the left side of the brain _that_ predominates. For left-handed people, however, the reverse is _true_ . For them, _it_ is the right side of the brain that is dominant. Thus, such people would tend to use the left side of their bodies in _whatever_ they do.
