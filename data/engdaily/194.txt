The _motel_ was rather quaint and warm. The owner was Percy Williams who doubled up as a receptionist and a porter. He _greeted_ me warmly and showed me my room. By then I was very _tired_ I jumped into bed and fell into a deep _sleep_ .The next morning, I woke up feeling very much refreshed. I realized that I was _covered_ with a blanket and my _clothes_ were neatly arranged in the closet. "Mr Williams is indeed a nice man," I thought to _myself_ . I decided that I would stay on in the motel for the _rest_ of my holidays.I met Mr Williams on my way out and _thanked_ him for his service. Mr Williams was surprised. "I didn't do anything except to show you to your room last night, Miss. It must be my _wife_ who did that."" Please convey my thanks to your wife then," I said as I moved to leave. Mr Williams' next few words _made_ me freeze.I'm afraid I can't, Miss. You see, my wife died a few years ago."
