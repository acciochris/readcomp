Why do people yawn ? No one seems to know the exact _answer_ . Some people believe that we yawn _because_ we do not have enough oxygen in our bodies. In _other_ words, we yawn to breathe in _more_ oxygen. People also believe that yawning is associated _with_ boredom. For example, _during_ a monotonous and dull lesson, you may feel bored _to_ tears. At that time, you are _likely_ to yawn very often.Yawning can also _be_ contagious. Have you ever had the _experience_ of a long wait at the doctor's clinic ? During the wait, someone may _give_ a long, tired yawn. When this _occurs_ , other people in the room may start to yawn _too_ .A psychologist, Dr Robert Provine, did some studies _about_ yawning. In one of _his_ experiments, Dr Provine asked his subjects to record _down_ the times of the day _when_ they yawn. He discovered that yawning is _most_ common during two times of the _day_ - the hour before sleep _and_ the hour after waking. He concluded that yawning is related _to_ stretching. People tend to yawn when they stretch _themselves_ .Dr Provine also _had_ several other interesting findings. _One_ of these findings is that people who read about yawning would start yawning. In fact, according to him, people _who_ think of yawning would start yawning.
