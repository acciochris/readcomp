There were many stalls set _up_ along the five-foot way in front of the shop-houses. Rough canvases had been spread _on_ the ground, and _all_ the hawkers' wares were neatly piled upon _them_ . There were interesting items of all _kinds_ : clay figurines, scarves, handcrafted silverware, hats and many other things of interest.The people at the 'pasar malam' were _as_ varied as the goods that were on _sale_ . However, it was crystal clear that they were all there to _seek_ bargains. There was much haggling _over_ the prices of the goods. Everyone _was_ swept into the light, gay mood that pervaded the bazaar. The bright lights and cheerful banter _between_ customers and hawkers created a most entertaining _atmosphere_ .I bought several unusual _pieces_ of pottery for my parents and a huge stuffed bear for my sister. For _myself_ , I bought a delightful train set which, _although_ old-fashioned, was _in_ perfect running order. It was also very cheap!
