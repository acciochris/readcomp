Achilles's secret was _that_ when he was a baby, his mother had immersed him _in_ the waters of the River Styx. The magical power of the water _protected_ him from any sort of injury he would come _across_ later in life.However, there was one _part_ of Achilles's body that was not protected - his heel. His mother had _overlooked_ this; she had _held_ him by his heel when she soaked him in the river. This weakness was to _become_ Achilles's downfall. One day, in a fierce _battle_ , Achilles killed a Trojan hero called Hector. _In_ retaliation, Hector's brother shot a deadly arrow _at_ Achilles's heel. As a result, Achilles died _from_ the poison in the arrow.
