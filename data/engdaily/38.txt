Once upon a time there was a king who loved to wear new clothes. He wanted a new outfit _made_ for himself every day, until finally, the royal tailor ran _out_ of ideas for his wardrobe.The tailor _racked_ his brains and then came _up_ with a plot to teach the vain king a _lesson_ . He told the king that he would make him a special robe this _time_ . It would be the most beautiful robe in the world, but _only_ intelligent people would be able to see it. The foolish, however, would not be _able_ to see or feel the robe. To make his story sound even _more_ credible, the tailor requested _for_ a week to finish his masterpiece. The king, fascinated _with_ the idea of owning the most beautiful robe in the world _agreed_ readily to his request.The week _passed_ quickly. The king tried _on_ the robe enthusiastically. To his horror, he could not see it ! Yet, he _kept_ quiet, fearing that others would say he was foolish _since_ he could not see the robe. He pretended that he was really _changing_ into the new robe and echoed the tailor's praises _of_ the beautiful robe. Finally, he paraded down the streets unclothed, not realising _that_ all the subjects of his kingdom were laughing _at_ him, including the tailor !
