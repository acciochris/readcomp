Squirrels are the most resourceful animal in the world. They have the knack of saving up for _rainy_ days.Autumn can be very entertaining _for_ them. That is the time _when_ they begin the great harvest collection _for_ their winter store. You can see them scampering here and _there_ , collecting nuts of _all_ sorts. Walnuts, beechnuts, chestnuts, dried berries ... They are not fussy. Relentlessly, they run _from_ their storage point, usually a tree hollow, _to_ the vast amount of wild nuts to be _found_ in the forest.These beautiful animals are house-proud. They take great _pains_ to ensure that their nest is secure and _warm_ enough to tide them _over_ the harsh winter. You will see them busily _collecting_ soft pieces of bark, wood and leaves to line _their_ nests.After all their scavenging _is_ done, and when the first, cold hard frost arrives, they will seal _themselves_ inside their nests for the _duration_ of the cold spell. There, they will hibernate _till_ it is warm enough to bring out their stored food. Ah, but then again, they are the _most_ forgetful little animals, and it is not _unusual_ to see squirrels searching desperately for their hoards.
