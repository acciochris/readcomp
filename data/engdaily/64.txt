The origins of the Olympic Games can be traced _back_ to ancient Greece, to as _far_ back as 776 B.C. It was a Greek tradition to _hold_ athletic competitions every four years _in_ honour of their gods or dead heroes. There were also competitions to _pit_ their skills in music _and_ poetry.The prizes awarded to the _winners_ of each event in those _days_ were a crown of olive and a palm branch. _Although_ this may seem meaningless in modern times, the true _prize_ lay in the honour of having won the event. The winners were _treated_ as heroes in their hometowns; they were _given_ places of honour on public occasions. In some towns, they were even exempted _from_ paying taxes.The first modern Olympics was held in Athens in 1896. _Since_ then, nations from around the world have been meeting _every_ four years to compete _against_ one another. New Olympic records are _set_ every time they meet. The only _exception_ to this quadrennial event was in 1944, _when_ the Olympic Games was not held _because_ of the Second War.
