Today, social change has developed in such a way _that_ most people do not want to draw clear _lines_ between the rich and the _poor_ . This is known as democratization. The trend has spread to _the_ area of dressing, so that fashion is no longer a rigid indication _of_ a person's social position. It is _true_ , however, that certain expensive brands of clothes are _affordable_ only to the rich. People who _buy_ these exclusive brands are immediately recognized _as_ the more well-to-do among us.
