Gorillas will only attack _when_ they feel threatened. This is why zoologists _studying_ these animals are careful not to observe them _through_ binoculars for long periods of time.Today, gorillas living _in_ the wild face many threats. This is because many of the forests in the world are being cut _down_ . Because the natural habitats _of_ these creatures are being destroyed, gorillas face the _threat_ of extinction in the future. _To_ help save the gorillas from extinction, some of these animals are bred in captivity in zoos all _over_ the world. The Singapore Zoological Gardens obtained _its_ first pair of gorillas in 1983. The two gorillas, _whose_ names were Saul and Goliath, were a _present_ from the Bristol Zoo in England.
